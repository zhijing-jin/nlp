## TYPICAL EXAMPLE REVIEW
    6
    [Background] came for a family birthday and were seated in the santos room .
    [Comment (good/bad)] the decor and ambiance is nice , the temperature was much too warm with what felt like no ac , just a small electric vertical fan .
    [Comment (good/bad)] the service was mediocre .
    [Comment (good/bad)] took a long time for drink refills or needed to ask more than once .
    [Comment (good/bad)] of our party they forgot to take the order for two people .
    [Comment (good/bad)] chips tasted stale and like old oil , salsa was ok .

## TYPES
### 1. PLAIN NARRATION
*	 i have been getting tattooed by rob @ urban art since _num_ .
*	 has anyone ever had an `` eddie murphy '' experience ?
*	 do you remember the movie _num_ hours ?
*	 when eddie murphy goes into the country bar and the music comes to a screeching halt and everyone turns and looks at him ?
*	 i usually get the garden enchiladas .
*	 my wife and i went out of our way to have lunch here .
*	 we stopped here on our way home from golf .
*	 for dinner i was in the mood for a steak so i had the jala holla steak .



### 2. CLEAR & SHALLOW SENTIMENT

####	2.1 EASY 
		food was amazing !
		we been here a few times and had a positive experience each time .
		love the decor .
		this is our favorite mexican restaurant now .
		yum it was delicious , i will be back for sure !
		our lunch here was really delicious !
		great drinks and apps as well .

####	2.2	CLEAR SENTIMENT, BUT USING COMMONSENSE
		i showed up with a friend who is not caucasian , and the bartender did n't acknowledge us at all although we both said hi .
		service was also one step behind denny 's .
		they simply take your order , and bring you good food , followed by the check .
		i will drive out of my way to go here when i 'm in town .
		also , how the hell does a fondue place run out of cheese ? !
		i think this place needs help .
		this place breaks your car so you have to go back to them !
		i 've got to figure out how they made it .
####	2.3 LONG CONTENT + sentiment in adj. verb. phrases
		we loved everything we had - guacamole , bean dip , blue seafood enchiladas , crab cake tacos , stacked steak enchilada with an egg , and beef chimichanga .
		i ordered the spooning relleno peppers with cheese and chorizo , breaded and fried , a huge plate with _num_ relleno and rice and beans , very tasty .
		highly recommended - the stacked enchiladas were excellent and the salsa is to die for .
		we had the lobster dip and the garlic shrimp pizza , both were really good .


### 3. INDIRECT SENTIMENT / EUPHEMISTIC (HARD-TO-CONVERT)
*	(NEG) they need to take down the sign `` ... ... somewhere in the world a vegan is crying ''
*	(NEG) whenever i am seated i always move because they always start placing people nearest to the door and i personally dont like being seated there !
*	(NEG) my tostado looked more like a salad with all the lettuce piled on it .		
*	(POS) i 've got to figure out how they made it .
*	(POS) open 24/7 !
*	(NEG) chips tasted stale and like old oil , salsa was ok .
*	(POS) you want a place for a first date ?
* (NEG) we have experienced some billing issues ( they overbilled us for a very long time , did n't tell us and just started giving us credits instead of asking if we wanted a refund ) and once they told us that we had no insurance coverage because my _num_ year old reached his lifetime max ( how does that even make sense ? ? ? ? ?



### 4. PARTLY NEG, PARTLY POS
*	i miss the mario machines they used to have , but it 's still a great place steeped in tradition .
*	i usually order the burger , while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen , all of the other ingredients are very fresh .
*	but other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order .
*	kind of disappointing ... .but the next day i get a message from the owner/manager apologizing for not calling in advance to make us aware of the closure .
*	now you will spend some money here , but if you really want a special night , this is the place .
*	the actual taste of the dessert was probably the only good thing going however , the restaurant use to offer more of each item of the desserts and when we asked why it changed our waitress explained it was because people would sit for hours upon hours just enjoying dessert asking for more pieces to enjoy their chocolate with .
*	casa reynoso is definitely nothing fancy , but the food is good and consistently so !
*	the service is n't great , but it is more of a hole-in-the-wall so i do n't expect much .
*	service is `` eh '' , but the food pretty good .

## TYPICAL MISTAKES
### 1. MISTAKES FOR ANTONYM CONVERTION
changing to the antonyms doesn't convert the sentiments

there are only _num_ pumps here and in a small parking lot so good luck trying to maneuver around when its busy .

### 2. MISTAKES FOR TF-IDF
long sentences

but when i went back in they told me they would not replace the order and their policy is you have to bring back the food to get it replaced but none of this was told to me when i called in about the screwed up order and had the name of the person who told me this over the phone and it was even written in their office book for order replacement and they refused to replace the order after making me sit and wait for _num_ minutes just to tell me this .
was thinking along the lines of a retainer and maybe have to replace the spacers as well but the staff simply told me to hang on while they brought the fork lift out , raised up the rear end , leaned in and twisted in the coils by hand ; also measured the half-to-half on the shocks and recommended a slightly shorter travel if i even wanted to prevent it from happening again ( not that my dw would ever let me get airborne ! ) .
