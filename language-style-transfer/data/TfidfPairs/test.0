had breakfast of eggs , ham and `` home fries . ''
this place is the good , the bad , and the ugly .
the black bean beef was the better of the two dishes .
the food is great , the service is terrible sometimes .
it was for a _num_ and did n't fit .
they said they only have deals monday through wednesday .
this is by far the worst place i have ever been .
it really is a pittsburgh staple but come on ... .
i hope i never have to return for service to this location .
good customer service but it does not make up for the food .
the servers are rude and slow , and the food is awful .
i love the products this company has but this location is the worst !
on top of the variety of issues , the workers are unfriendly and inefficient .
ordered over _num_ items on both the breakfast menu and the szechuan menu .
meat in all the dishes was tender but not very flavorful .
some of them have daily specials running monday thru friday .
usually it is clean and done in a timely manner .
i 've been there for breakfast and lunch and it 's ok .
the building looks exactly like what it is : a whole in the wall .
if you are looking for tasteless mexican this is your place .
i had a buffet and the salad is all mixed together with the dressing .
this is the worst place to do business with .
also my mom had chicken salad and walnuts in it .
the service is ridiculous and the food is gross .
sorry bill johnson 's ... you just lost us .
the sweet and sour sauce is bitter and stale .
you do not get the service you pay for .
third course , i ordered the key lime pie , it was not edible .
staff ( besides assistant manager ) is completely incompetent .
the saving grace for blue fin are the portions and price point .
if you want authentic chinese food this is not the place .
bubble tea also terrible , the worst i 've had .
i will avoid the squirrel hill location in the future .
but no more than two stars , because the prices are so ridiculous .
the service was slow but the portions were large .
it 's really not a bad place to watch a game .
your service is getting worse each time i come .
now i can see why the employee was so confused .
i was not going to pay for the dressing on the side .
people who enjoy good bbq should avoid this place .
well , there were about _num_ fans and 4-5 other people in casual attire .
if you want slow service this is the place to go .
but i was amazed at how poor the service was .
it 's closed now , they have several mall locations .
nasty just take a look at the picture and you will see .
after being seated , it took _num_ minutes before they took our drink order .
so do n't even bother tipping them on the table .
he said , `` sorry , that 's just the way it is . ''
she was useless , as were the rest of the staff .
i stopped to get two different kinds of wings .
my brother and his girlfriend recently had their baby shower .
inside , the place is old and worn , but clean .
i wish i could remember this one 's name .
the waitress that took our order and served us was quite rude .
italian sausage , black olives , onions , garlic and basil .
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
some of the worst service i have ever seen .
went here for my birthday and was so disappointed .
it was late so we sat in the bar area .
the place is dirty and not as lively as it was .
just not a great or big plate of food for the price .
it was all i could do not to make a scene .
my french toast comes out with no syrup and no apples .
the steaks were mediocre , ruth chris even pinnacle peak patio steaks tasted better .
they just lost my money cause no one would ask if i needed help .
when you walk in they do n't greet you or smile or anything .
i dropped off my dog first thing in the morning when they opened .
other than that service was terrible and food was mediocre .
( the other guy at the counter was nice though .
but if you are in the area it is n't to bad .
we 've been going there for _num_ years and will never be back .
the complimentary chips and salsa were just as bad .
although , i have so many friends who love this place .
she was very annoyed that we did not know what we wanted .
and do n't expect anybody checking you frequently to see if your dining experience .
i came for lunch today and was very disappointed .
i am all about customer service and i was disappointed .
some of the worse service i have ever received !
i am not looking forward to going back there .
the lack of customer service the girl behind the bar offered was atrocious .
the dressing is also low in calories which is an added bonus !
this was the most disappointing trip we have ever had !
if you like heat , go for the _num_ stars .
the produce section is the worst of the store .
if that is what you are looking for this is not your spot .
the employees at this location were very unprofessional and unorganized .
there are plenty of better choices next time ... .
i walk in , look around , look at the menu ... hmmm .
but if you are in the area it is n't to bad .
but it is pricey ( for ice cream i mean ) .
sushi review : spicy tuna rolls were in no way spicy .
i 've never been disappointed with the food or service there .
the food was ok , not out of this world .
the staff is rude and store is usually very dirty .
oh yeah , and we got sick from the food too !
the food was very cheap , and servers sweet .
this was not the experience i hoped for ... .
it 's a wonderful way to waste the last day of my vacation .
this place is trying to be something it is not .
the employees were friendly and i was in and out in no time .
we did n't get that warm fuzzy feeling we used to get while visiting .
i was visiting from out of town and was brought here by some locals .
is it worth the $ _num_ cover on fridays ?
another hour was waited just to get called to the back .
as terrible as the food was , the service was nice .
if you like that stuff , then this is the place for you .
come to think of it , i 'd do better cutting our hair myself !
this is my first experience with chicken and waffles .
if you have n't been to big lots , you should check it out .
the lady who did my nails was rude , impatient and not detailed .
the gym is dirty and the equipment is out of date .
had brunch here and was recommended lobster eggs benedict .
so on to the sushi , oh yeah , it 's gross too !
i will never go back and i always tell my friends to avoid it .
the ingredients were n't fresh and the food was n't cooked properly .
the staff was less than friendly ( especially when checking in ) .
i was referred to this place by a friend actually .
the bathrooms were nasty dirty , next time i 'll just hold it .
the atmosphere in the store always has a negative vibe .
i showed up _num_ mins after the expected time .
as far as dive bars go , this one is pretty bad .
she also printed out my favorites and brought them for me .
i was so disappointed and angry at the same time .
my bacon cheese burger was dry and bland too .
the beer was decent , it 's just draft beer here .
this location always is horrible when it comes to service and food .
the ingredients were n't fresh and the food was n't cooked properly .
which is n't terrible but the experience was less than pleasant .
i will drive a little farther to get better service .
if you want a good laugh , try to get the waiter i got .
the worst bar and the worst service in the area .
i had a suite , but it was not very sweet .
we met up with a group of people of approximately _num_ people .
bought _num_ new tires and left the car with them .
i 've been here twice and both times were horrible .
this used to be one of my favorite places to eat .
which in my opinion , should n't be an issue for a professional cleaners .
this was one of the most disgusting restaurants ive ever been in .
went in for a few highlights on shoulder length hair .
the people working there were very nice just the food was not worth it .
too bad they prefer to have an unhappy customer .
very nice guy but i did n't exactly get what i asked for .
the bad : the broth was not very good .
i 've had salads here before , and they 've always been good .
i went for the first time today and was extremely disappointed .
came here because of the great reviews and as totally disappointed !
just a flat course in the middle of the desert .
i have eaten here several times & always find it disappointing .
never again ... i encourage the same to anyone searching .
the food is not very good but there prices are very reasonable .
this is n't a bad place for lunch or dinner .
the filet was not good meat and the lobster was dry .
this is one of the worst medical centers i 've been to .
i just had the chicken parm and it was terrible .
the salad dressing was tasteless and the osso bucco was just okay .
walked in on a busy fish fry night for the first time .
it came with `` country potatoes '' , and toast .
the prices are extremely ridiculous for what you get .
i do n't know how on earth this place can survive .
it was so bad i left in tears and will never go back .
it 's very bland and is not full of flavor .
we ate and left and we are never coming back .
the only restaurant in walking distance is a denny 's .
we had the worst lunch here today from start to finish .
i 've been here a couple of times and had no bad experiences .
i thought for sure this would become my home away from home .
i have n't been here in about a year .
they were fast , friendly and ready to go with our to go orders .
one of the worst mexican restaurants i 've eaten in .
you do not get the service you pay for .
we ordered a _num_ '' thin crust with pepperoni , sausage & mushrooms .
the dim sum was bland and not much variety .
unfortunately , i know what a mai tai is supposed to taste like .
this is probably one of the better places phoenix has to offer .
it 's a very cheap place to have a drink .
inconsistent food , dirty environment , rude staff and not a positive experience .
sadly its one of the better bars in middleton .
the food was not great and not worth the price at all .
i will avoid this place from now on for sure .
like the biltmore hotel , royal palms , or the phoenician .
our entres were decent , nothing too exciting but not horrible either .
enough to really bother me while i was eating and studying .
the bf , however , really did n't like it .
pizza was decent but the restaurant itself is disappointing .
these were not tiny lap dogs or service dogs .
if you ca n't appreciate your customer 's why should they appreciate you .
went to the new location last night and was sadly disappointed .
the fresh pork rolls were plain and not worth the price .
we ordered wings , bbq chicken pizza ( no onions ) and garlic knots .
my palate is n't that sophisticated , i guess .
i was disappointed with the service i got at this cracker barrel .
you be the judge , is it not a simple layout ?
the margaritas were extremely weak and the food was just bland .
i was sent to the new chandler location , though .
i love this middle eastern food , but this was a disappointing meal .
the front desk personnel is useless and very very weak .
the food itself is not tasty and and `` clean '' .
sure , there is a large variety of items to choose from .
not exceptional , but more than i had expected .
my son had their `` famous '' meatball sub which was also very bland .
the next day , i was sick all day .
the cheese stick was good and hot and how a cheese stick should taste .
to say that i was disappointed would be an understatement .
horrible customer service and do not care about their patients .
the biggest disappointment was the vegetarian vegetable noodles ( hong kong style ) .
never came out even though we asked _num_ times , we just canceled it .
i would n't recommend this one if you 're in a rush .
i felt like they would never trust my judgement again .
i always feel rushed and my questions are not answered .
she was kind and she did n't charge us for an unnecessary x-ray .
not my first time here , definitely my last .
my first time here and i will not be back !
i 'm all for the long holiday weekend , i think it 's great .
showed no effort in helping or listening to anyone .
i do not recommend going there for your children .
not what i wanted , and not a good look .
it 's not bad , but it 's not spectacular .
( it turned out to be _num_ % ) .
my food was not good- i ordered the breakfast enchilada .
this is n't a bad place for lunch or dinner .
it was a wreck in there and i felt so bad for everyone working .
i felt safe and secure leaving our little one with them .
we ordered the gnocchi and it was way too doughy .
only on the strip you can get away with that !
we ordered the full sized breakfast burritos with cheddar and black forest bacon .
and it 's like this _num_ out of _num_ times .
i do n't come here anymore - bad vibes .
no early bird , no late bird , no prime rib .
verizon sucks but they are all pretty much the same .
it 's very bland and is not full of flavor .

i was so excited to go here with my husband .
one of the worst places to get customer service .
the service has always been bad , rude servers .
i 'm sorry but this is not good italian food .
not the first time we have had poor service here .
the prices for the drinks are overpriced to me .
if you remember the old eagle mountain you will be disappointed .

the play place has no doors so the kids just run around everywhere .
this was only my second time there the last .
the food is mediocre at best and very greasy .

black cod fish ( _num_ stars ) : perfectly cooked .

this is an extremely smoky bar with terrible music .
the fish taco was good , but the chicken taco was really sloppy .
if given the chance again i would n't have another party here .
i 'm sorry but my latest experience here has been horrible .
not that the tzatziki sauce was rotten , it just was not tzatziki sauce .

the neighbors are horrible and the apartments are tiny .
the worst restaurant we have been to in charlotte .
it was the worst service i have had in a long time .
we left the restaurant and i will never return .
there were _num_ girls working and me in the store .
i 've had far , far better at much more reasonable prices .
we will not go back and will not recommend it to our friends .
was n't sure what to get so i go a few things .
i hope i never have to return for service to this location .
i will not be back and will not recommend .
the food was awful and the server was the worst .
with three people in the restaurant , that 's a little ridiculous .
i will not be recommending this place to anyone .
not having a computer is very hard especially when you 're a student !
salad was decent , but just a greek salad .
if you like tasteless food , this is your place .
the service was terrible and the place was packed .
a shame because i like the german menu items .
this was no corned beef i 've ever seen .
the food is mediocre but the service is terrible .
again , their website was what would not accept payment .
i 've been going here for _num_ years & will not be going back .
even if you are _num_ they will not serve you !
the worst service i have had in a long time.
it really is a pittsburgh staple but come on ... .
they 're doing some remodeling , but no excuse !
i do n't like the woman who works there .
i drank my beer she had her wings and we left .
the blackened ahi was cold in spots and warm in spots .
i am very disappointed in the service that we have received .
thanks for the horrible treatment and a waste of time and money !
the collard greens lacked flavor and they were cold .
you get a decent amount of the bad food .
i 'll help you , this place is bad .
it was my favorite thing and i honestly could n't stop eating it .
the list of food sounded great and included many typical hawaiian items .
they were hard and clearly not made from scratch .
like i was asking him to do my taxes .
i 'm sorry to say this was an absolutely terrible experience .
if you like horseradish go for it , if not stay away .
our waiter seemed to be rushed creating a very uncomfortable atmosphere .
the lady that helped me was very rude and unprofessional .
the bread in the basket was stale and hard .
service was slow , food was very very inconsistent .
it has to be one of the worst things on the menu .
at least once a month our sunday paper is not delivered to us .
what can i say , this place is the worst !
this would have been more than enough for me .
the place was empty , we were greeted by a very sweet waitress .
the standard comes with a hot stone , but no one offered a menu .
the odd food selections are maybe a cross between southern style and fake chinese .
maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .
the rice was some of the worst i have ever had .
i have n't been here in a long time .
however , i 'm in pittsburgh , where can i go ?
you get a decent amount of the bad food .
if you know me , you know i can eat .
it was very awkward and i felt very uncomfortable .
my cup of coffee was not even 1/2 way full .
the lady who cut his hair was so rude .
sorry , that 's not why i go to a restaurant .
it is by far the cheapest motel in the town .
i wanted to try something different and was excited to try some new makeup .
you can tell the staff is n't well trained .
this is the second time i left here disappointed .
bottom line , the food was tasteless and terrible .
had we of saw this before we ate we would have walked out .
i will say however i liked the cheese to sauce ratio .
but sadly , they have lost the art of making great food .
if you are looking for good food this is not the place .
so , i went with a staple dish , vegetable lo mein .
as we were leaving , a lady ( hostess ?
it was one of the worst sandwiches i have ever had .
very rude , it 's not all of them .
but your customer service and attention to detail is atrocious .
she did not listen to our requests and she was not very accommodating .
they really are n't out to impress , only to fill your belly .
everyone , the greeter , the cashier and even the owner were rude .
as others have said , decor and location are horrible .
i have been here several times in the past and have left pleased .
everyone in our group felt this way , it was not just me .
so , i would not recommend this place for families who have kids .
again my fish sandwich which i love is overly dry .
the menu is limited , and you have no options .
so , i asked , does the glaze have butter in it or something ?
i called the store and talked to two people to get some help .
i figured i 'd give it one more shot but they failed , again .
i avoid this place as much as i can .
best pho in vegas but the service is slow and horrible .
the food is not very good but there prices are very reasonable .

service was quick and polite , but not super personable .
she was unhappy and i told her to complain .
this was by far the worst place i have ever eaten .

all in all , i would n't go back .
awful place , to bad i was looking forward .
the food is not as good as other places .
horrible , the chef was unhappy to be behind the counter .
the german chocolate cake was dry and also tasteless .
there just were n't many options to be had .
the prices are cheap , but it 's not worth it .
our waitress was in attentive and seemed annoyed with any requests .
not to mention their prices are now comparable to better quality fast food places .
well many years ago this place was not so bad .
anyone who wants the taste of bbq this is not the place to go .
it 's like mexican food for people who do n't like mexican food .
there were only three tables sitting in the restaurant .
hands down the worst service i 've ever had .
i 'm a burger lover and this was just terrible .
very pricey and not much food for your money .
we would have not been able to view the events for the evening .
i had the shrimp salad and it was horrible .

i also am not really sure of the quality of their meats .
if you 're looking for good bbq and fresh this is n't the place .
went here with a group of friends and the food was terrible .
i ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and was disappointed .
i 'm really surprised this place has such good reviews .
it 's on the pricey side , but you probably know that already .
when asked if i wanted it grilled or blackened , i chose grilled .
the people that work here are always extremely rude .
it 's starbucks so you know what you are getting .
i have been here _num_ times and both times were terrible .
i 'll stay elsewhere next time i 'm in town .
this used to be my favorite restaurant for special occasions .
i think it is one of the worst in the valley .

this is not the place to go for thai food in phoenix .
i went here tonight after hearing good things about the place .
for a $ _num_ meal it was a huge portion .

the owner of the restaurant and his wife were very rude and not accommodating .

the atmosphere is quiet and a little awkward at dinner time .
... especially considering they 're not all that great .
it will be a while till we try this again.
the server and chef were very efficient and personable .
i have never been to a less taken care of establishment .
when you first walk into the restaurant , you 're not even welcomed .
portion sizes were large and we had lots of leftovers .
it 's also no cheaper than any of the other places around there .
if you choose to go with them it 's your own fault .
has to be the worst service department i have ever been to .
but i hate , hate , hate the shoes .
so instead i had some yellow curry with potatoes and chicken .
from the moment you walk in they make you feel like your home .
our appetizer of stuffed mushrooms were plain and tasteless .
the sitting area was a nice size and the kitchenette area was clean .
sadly they are the only one located in south side .
i think this is the most expensive in wickenburg for breakfast .

i then took inventory of my suits and found that _num_ suits are missing !
i ate half the sandwich , and took the other half home .
did everything they could to avoid doing the right thing .
price : you do not get what you paid for .
the meal should have had atleast four times the amount of beef .
the quality of the clothing was pathetic and most of the items were ugly .
this used to be one of my favorite places .
he should n't have been put in that position .
the view was amazing , the food was not .
if you 're on a budget , take your chances in staying here .
and worse , the food and food handling is nasty .
while the food was fine , it just was n't great .
as a matter of fact , it was n't even good .
the produce section is the worst of the store .
and the brand supplements that i like , they did n't carry .
not sure why it would be featured on the show .

the employees are rude and not at all helpful .

this port of subs is the worst i 've ever been to .
there is no love lost between customers and employees here .
the animals were so poorly taken care of it was absolutely sad .
i got a soup and salad combo , really basic .
their food is sandwiches ( hot or cold ) , soups , and salads .
this place smelled awful as soon as you walked in the door .
this is was my first time at this location .
this place always seems to be dead or filled with a much older crowd .
the bad : the broth was not very good .
`` wait , i have to come in to set up an appointment ? ''
there 's too many other sub shops to come back .
it is illegal and dishonest to run a business like that .
