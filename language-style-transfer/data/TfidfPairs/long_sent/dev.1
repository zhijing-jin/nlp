when i first walked in , i was alone and totally sober , which is kind of a strange feeling when the entire place is drunk , and rowdy .
they have all the fixins , mustard , onions , peppers , relish , mayo ... pretty much anything you could ever want your porky goodness to swim in .
this time , they did a manifold back exhaust for me , to include all new pipe , new o2 sensor bung , new catalytic converter and glass pack .
i think they need to staff a little bit better because we knew she was only going to give us our pitcher and not return to take our order .
not sure if i saw anything related to a 'bakery ' but definitely this place serves great authentic tacos like the ones you would get from a taco truck .
whether it 's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you 'll have fun if you do n't expect it to be merc , cuz merc it ai n't .
also , if you have an idea of what needs to be done , they can look up the labor charges on the spot and give you a quote .

i have to switch to the seafood though at least _num_ of those _num_ times , for fear of clogging my arteries- but boy what a way to go .
i have no idea what the proper name is , but seriously , could it be cooler than `` i would like to eat the hot lava bowl ? ''
unless you wan na pay twice as much or more , this is the best mexican restaurant in the valley -- and i lived there for _num_ years straight .
the ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender and cooked to perfection , but their brisket is a real treat - slightly smokey with a seasoning that compliments their barbeque sauce amazingly .
we ordered mostly from the happy hour menu , which was 5pm-9pm monday-friday , which gave us a bunch of rolls , and even tempura for ~ $ _num_ .
capicola & cheese is my fav and though i 'm not a fan of cole slaw , the fact that it 's a dry slaw does it for me .
a couple can each have a combination meal including an entre , soup , deep fried pork , white or brown rice and a spring roll for under $ _num_
after a few minutes one of the clerks walked up to me , held up a jacket and told me my mom was wondering if i would like it .
ok , it could have been my company , but i was so impressed with everything here last night , this will quickly become one of my favorite lounges/restaurants .
we ordered the walnut shrimp , general 's chicken , shrimp chow mein and hot and sour soup - we also had the egg rolls and a crab rangoon .
they did a nice job on the bumper , and gave me an extra bottle of the paint that they used in case i need it in the future .
i had ordered a pair of restricted shoes in the past online and wore them for years , so finding them here at ten toes was a great surprise .
jay and his crew were so helpful in swapping cabinets and tops - so i could see a variety of options and i 'm so happy with my purchase .
to all those that read this posted sorry i jumped around in it so much my brain is trying to recover from all the drinking i 've been doing .
the man himself `` chuck reynolds '' and i ate here ( he introduced me to it ) and he had an egg salad sandwich that looked amazing too .
well i got the chicken fried chicken and it was the best i 've ever had , and i 'm from texas , so that 's surprising to me .

harley davidson of scottsdale az was a blast , every thing went great , the staff was fun , everyone liked their jobs , wonderful building ! ! ! !
he happily obliged when i asked him to deepen some shading and had me look at the finished tattoo several times to make sure i was ok with everything .
they use pureology in their great lineup of salon products , which was another plus- i did n't leave without the yummy smelling spray laura used during my style .
i had a flawless experience from the moment i called to inquire about a dress to my last final dress pick up ( they streamed my dress for free ! )
it 's thin , soft crust and very greasy , so if you ever ate at a neighborhood pizzeria on the east coast , you 're probably familiar with it .
they spent _num_ min ( no charge ) taking with me and explaining to me what they could do to fix the tattoo and bring out new detail and shading .
they care about their work and i go out of my way to take my car there because i know they put their history with my vehicle to good use .
he seated a couple before us that we arrived before and then seated us at a table that was inconvenient with a post , cutting off part of our party .
the location is great right behind the tropicana and across the street ( and kinda behind ) the mgm grand , legitly a maybe _num_ min walk from the strip .
they also seem to have upped their customer service , in that after you place your order , they actually escort you to your table and bring you your food .
i 'm a fan of ri ra because one of my favorite cover band plays here often ... and it 's a nice low key joint for the most part .
they use that independence well , not just delivering a steady stream of jeopardy and wheel of fortune , but producing nearly ten hours of local news programming each day .
when we first came in we thought it was going to be crazy packed considering it was fathers day but we ended up waiting only 15-20 mins which was nice .
i 'm a fan of the joint - but like my friend quoted on her review , i 'm disappointed in the amount of vegetables you receive in your meal .
she was very thorough in her approach , and while the office was busy that day , i could tell she was paying close attention to me during my appointment .
after dinner we sampled a few different types of desserts and i highly recommend the new york style cheesecake- it was the best cheese cake that i have ever had !
i 've lived in the charlotte area all of my life ( _num_ yrs ) and the open kitchen is the same now as it was when i was young .

he also gave me a manicure and did a really really good job clipping all of my cuticles , i 'm picky about my cuticles and he did it right !
one thing that would make it even better- electronic tickets so i do n't have to give my phone number every time and they do n't have to manually write it..
this is my second time to dr. fife , i had my first root canal about _num_ years ago , and i remembered how easy and fast the procedure was .

i was pleased to find a great , little sushi spot and have eaten there many times in the last year ... their takeout service is quick and easy too !
afterwards we took the elevator to the top of the eiffel tower which ended up being a catastrophe cause my girl is terrified of heights which i didnt know lol .
the only complaint we had was the room doors close really loud -- you can hear them slamming all day and night , far louder than the freemont street experience .
this place is busy but i 've never not been able to get in , had some measurements taken and picked up my clothes looking and feeling great on me .
head chef payton curry blew up and stormed out of the kitchen ... very hgtv of him and is was hilarious and very cryptic ... .. well played cafe boa !
their concessions stand is half serve yourself ; you can pick up nachos and fill your own icee and soda but someone has to serve you popcorn and you check .
it was n't filled up when we got there , but it was ok with us , because we did n't have to fill up when we brought it back .
dr. brendan johnson put me completely at ease regarding my upper jaw surgery ( aka orthognathic surgery ) while also thoroughly informing me of the pros and risks of surgery .
after the sealing , they walk around the outside of your home with you and make recommendations for clearing areas of your hard where scorpions might like to hide out .
it 's expensive compared to other restaurants , but the experience for us has always been worth far more the price , and we are eagerly anticipating our next visit .
this came in a big bowl and a plate with sprouts and some delicious herb on the side , which i guessed was some type of basil ( ? ) .

i asked why the burgers were so good asking if was the seasoned grill and he said the key was they use fresh unfrozen meat and just salt and pepper .
i love the soft shell shredded beef tacos ( order _num_ or _num_ at the very least ) and the carne asada burrito , better tasting then at a restaurant .

it 's the little things in life -- like a perfectly made grande iced white mocha ( no whip ) handed over with a `` have a nice day ! ''
but the real reason why i am giving this business _num_ stars is based on the fact that the owner and the staff of this establishment are helpful and honest .
we were able to take pictures during this tour which does n't happen in a lot of museums these days and i took everything i could until my camera died .

our insurance can be tricky , but his staff made calls on our behalf and took the time to explain our medical benefits ; this helped us to prepare financially .
first let me start by saying i am not a fan of fish , but it did say it was one of their top sellers and i can see why .
also , found on their specialty menu , you 'll find the iced neapolitan ( chocolate , vanilla , strawberry ) and the tropical treat ( coconut and almond ) .
we 'll miss our neighbors , and our favorite hangouts , but hopefully someone new can move in and enjoy our old home , and our great view of the sunrise !

it 's probably good that i drive a stick-shift car because it was all that i could do to not grab a piece and start munching on my ride back home .

the butcher was n't familiar with my request , but went out of his way , opened a new bag of meat and gave me the cut i was looking for , instead of brushing me off and saying he ca n't help me .
i was speaking to steven tenwick a few hours before making the drive down to autonation toyota to see what was the lowest bid on a new _num_ camry and they had the lowest bid out of all _num_ toyota dealerships here in las vegas .
well this place will do it , i bring almost all my tailoring here , they have turned long sleeve shirts into short sleeve shirts and no one is the wiser , and they have fixed everything i have ever brought them the first time .
we were in such a big rush and my wife asked the girl at the counter if she could borrow some tape and scissors to wrap the toy we just bought and she totally went out of her way to get us what we needed .
seriously , if you 're going to complain about an included _num_ % tip when _num_ % is customary , then stay at home drinking mountain dew and modeling your newest affliction shirts from ross dress for less - you 're not fit for public anyway .
but then something amazing happens , he tests my battery to make sure that 's what the problem is and tells me i should go to the dealer because the battery will still be covered under warranty and they will have to replace it for free .
the main reason why i came here to see if that place is selling banana agua fresca ( fresh water ) since walmart on bethany home road in glendale do sell those agua fresca ( including banana fresh water ) that was made from this place .
when i called to tell her the salt treatment was n't working and was trying to get some questions answered she said to come back in and do another scale test for another $ _num_ ... .that seemed ridiculous to me and then i remember aquarium arts .
then when i was leaving she told me that if i needed another treatment ( usually takes 1-3 to work fully ) then she would honor the living social price for the next _num_ which was like a _num_ % savings ... i def recommend this office !
we actually felt really bad for him because we know that is a servers worst nightmare ... he was lucky that he did that to our table and not another club member ... somehow i do n't think they would have been as nice as we were .
i geared up for a battle but was pleasantly surprised when the manager told me he 'd have someone there in a little bit and i could stop by any time the rest of the day and get my money back and a free wash for the trouble .
on one occasion i went there with a friend and she asked me whats good here , i simply stated '' ask the bartender '' and the bartender proceeded to ask her what types of beers she drinks and then gave her some recommendations based on her taste .
the only issues : one server forgot to bring my coworker her drink , but she apologized and made it right immediately upon realizing it ; we had just a little back and forth with the order of the checks being passed out ( almost all were individual ) .
i brought my cat to him when he was just a little guy , and the doctor could n't have been any sweeter to him ... now this may sound like a generic sort of statement , but to me , it showed a real love for his profession .
in general this is a great breakfast spot to hit up ... oh and also a decent joint for sandwiches , my favorite being the russian reuben with the tender beef , great sauerkraut , along with the cheese & thousand island dressing combo that make for a delicious combination .
i am writing this several weeks after my visit , so i do not remember much specifics but the dry hot pot dishes were amazing.. oh and for a tasty rare treat , get the xiao long bao.. they are little dumplings filled with meat and soup , a must try .
there 's no other fun places for kids to really go in las vegas , the adventure dome is cool with a bunch of rides for all ages , and the mid way has tons of games for all of your an adult and you like games then visit the midway .
well , since it is too depressing to listen to any media outlet right now , i actually have no idea what this station offers except this : third thursdays ( _num_ north craftsman court , old town scottsdale , az _num_ , between dos gringos and upper deck , 3rdthursdaysworld.com ) .
i knew that madison was the hq of `` justcoffee.coop '' by listening to marc maron 's wtf podcast , so when i stopped in to do a show , i called the people at justcoffee and asked them if they 'd recommend a local shop tht served their free trade coffee .
we were very blessed to have found this law firm .matthew gabbato is the nicest young man and was so thorough in helping my mom draw up her estate and will plans.wise and receptive and knew exactly what we needed to do.he is there for every call.this attorney was definitely raised right !
engineer hats , captain 's hats , straw hats , jester 's hats ... you name it , and they range in price and quality from `` cheap and only needs to 'read ' from the stage '' to `` a little more expensive and something you might actually wear out ! ''
please be aware that they only serve their full ala carte menu at night , during the day was buffet only and the last time we went they only had _num_ dishes which were dairy-free , so we had to bounce , which was super disappointing because i was fiending their food .
me and the wife wanted to eat somewhere nice so we picked gallagher 's , no regrets on that choice , made my reservation thru yelp , ask for a booth or somewhere nice and quite ( romantic ) , the place was pretty much empty on a monday night , good for us .
i contacted many dealers in town to return a lease and get a new one.autonation nissan with there sales person david froemming was the only one who accepted to do everything via email.without questions they send me the numbers.never once i was asked to come down to the dealership `` for a better deal !
this man is amazing.. i had severe nerve facial pain from shingles and he was the only one that helped me without narcodics.. i went for my back the treatment at the time hurt to much so he stopped and didnt charge me for his time.. what a doll.. will be back to see him again..
on a side note , i was there with my dad and sister one night and all our food arrived at the same time- i felt like we were descended upon on by the staff , anticipating and attending to the smallest detail , and then they were gone to leave us to enjoy our meal .
! plus they have great deals on mondays they have _num_ breakfast burritos ... wednesdays they have _num_ chicken tacos seriously i could eat here all week ... then again my body would n't be happy with all the working out i would need to do ... thank you roberto 's for feeding me such delicious food ^_-
i have to say that whether you are a guy or a gal , you will find that the people here are very friendly and it is hard to prevent them from escorting you to the aisle ( no really , it is fine , just tell me the aisle number and i can find it ! )
i am hoping that when we go on our usual tuesday 's the bartender has been moved to different days but if i happen to run into him again in the future i hope to god he calls for a manager before he tries to offer us a closed dim lit restaurant again for two people of a usual 4+ party .
if you happen to find yourself transferring ( and many of you there will , since most of you do not actually live in charlotte ) , you will invariably be dropped at the end of one concourse and have to make it to the end of another with about _num_ minutes to make your connection , what with the airline industry being what it is and all .
once the lady at the counter broke something we 'd painted ( when i 'd come to pick it up ) thankfully it was something small and not creatively painted , she apologized more than _num_ times , offered to let me paint another one and then said she would paint it and i could pick it up the next day , then she gave me _num_ free sitting passes .
the only *bad* ( more so just personally annoying ) , thing i 've ever come across here , had nothing to do with the food itself or even the servers..well not our server..was when one of the ladies walking around clearing tables felt the need to express to us that she has ocd therefore , we needed to remove the last _num_ pieces of bruchetta from the board , so she could clear it..because it was making her uncomfortable..
we arrived in las vegas and due to issues with our flight it took _num_ hours to get our cases and i thought he would be long gone as it was after the time we booked but to my surprise we came out and chris was wait with our name on his ipad he took us straight out to our stretch suv and even helped with our bags and my wedding dress etc he got us in and gave us a drink made us comfortable for our drive to the hotel .
a few caveats for this tour - it 's guided , so you wo n't be able to mill around ( this contrasted from my tour of frank lloyd wright 's hollyhock house earlier this year , where you go as you like and there are docents available to answer questions ) ; many sections of the house are off-limits ( consistent with my experience at other flw houses ) ; and it 's indoor/outdoor , so depending on the time of day or season , be sure you are dressed and bring sunscreen or mosquito repellent as appropriate ; and yes , you can bring your camera ( surprised me , as inside hollyhock they requested no photography ) .
ate here a couple of weeks ago and i got to say the food is good but not as good as robertos and the don mexican restaurant on sahara but i enjoyed my meal the only negative is the price it is very pricey here so expect to pay more for a burrito and some tacos or fries but i enjoy this place and is part of my top _num_ favorite mexican restaurants to eat at just wish the carne asada burrito was n't as greasy as it was the last time i ate it but it was still good also the customer service is okay at best i have seen worse but overall this is another one of my go to mexican restaurants to eat at when i 'm in the mood to grab something to eat and i do n't feel like cooking .
