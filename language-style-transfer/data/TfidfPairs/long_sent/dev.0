so if you must go to this place try and order that .
and a b & n nearby ?

the food was average and the atmosphere was n't too inviting .
how does that make any sense at all ?
i had the new york strip , and some scallops .
really sad as this was an icon of vegas .
( + ) : great location , great atmosphere , good beer
so it 's been awhile since my last visit here .
i went to this mall with some expectation but i was disappointed .
usually this place is fast and courteous .
i do n't know what everyone is talking about ...
went for a late night snack .
service , ambiance and bread were good .
did you ever watch that show ?
i did n't feel that was very professional .
i like my apartment and it 's relatively quiet .

give it a try if you will .
_num_ for the chocolate chip cookies being delicious !

little mom n pop type of place ...
food was over priced , and the taste was so so .

these guys do n't deserve even _num_ star .
time to find a new location to shop at

also , what happened to all the sandwiches ?
i would n't recommend this establishment to anyone .
it was so crowded and loud !
maybe one day , i 'll try again .

hiro sushi is my new go-to .

i had the mahi mahi tacos and they were just ok .
the store itself is very open , clean and well organized .

that 's exactly what i did .

_num_ for biscuits and gravy with toast and hash browns .
so no room in the shuttles .

the beds were clean and comfortable .
so i was not satisfied with their food .
food comes out of order or not at all .
and thanks for the courtesy call ! ! ! !
i 'm surprised to see great reviews .
the place can also use more cleaning .
repaired a tire that should not have been repaired .
the staff was nice and friendly .
i used to go here at least once a week..
some of the best food i had in az .
we had fun because we were in a large group .
the service and live music was nice .
i ordered a hot turkey sandwich .
these guys do n't deserve even _num_ star .
my wife and i came here after christmas shopping .
food was ok , but not spectacular .
however , the lima beans were great .
the price and the red sauce will hook you in .
i expect more from you starbucks !
the bartender shannon was a to total b .
a chain is a chain is a chain .
but the coconut water was refreshing .
loved the steak sandwiches , pizza , wings and everything .
shortly after purchase , the washer door was not latching properly .
ca n't wait to go back !
all in all not a great experience .
it is almost an snl skit .
that 's straight to the point !
she did a quick job and not a great job .
overall do n't recommend this place ...
a ) it 's very affordable .
this place is delicious and healthy but the price is absolutely ridiculous .
how is this place `` famous '' ?
that 's the only thing this place has going for it .
the rest of the staff was great .
i expect so much more from this chain .
service is good , staff is friendly and knowledgeable .
store is very clean and well maintained .
the service was slow but the portions were large .
the food though , is pretty damn good .
i ordered an avocado chicken salad .
the service was friendly and clean environment .
pretty small with good service most of the time .
they used canned mango for my mango and sticky rice dessert .
their prosciutto and melon was also outstanding .
i came down here to donate .
great sauce and a nice thin crust .
so if you must go to this place try and order that .
we did n't get a chance to taste the food .
this was the most boring musicals i have ever seen .
finally gave up and ordered on line .
i wish i would have taken a picture .
however this was not meant to be .

the food here is really bad .
they were not great and i would n't recommend them to others .
i spent $ _num_ ! ! ! !

this is a neighborhood bar for me .

have to complain about food and drinks .

not a very good place to bring kids of you want your kids to read .
this restaurant is from the _num_ 's and you can tell .
they are friendly and willing to accommodate all .

things were n't great from the beginning .
the lasagna tasted like `` greek '' lasagna and had nutmeg in the sauce .
overall it was not the best mani/pedi i 've had .
this is the worst strip club in vegas .
no more all you can eat catfish !
but the owner/guy behind the bar , needs to lighten up .
quality also varies greatly for order to order .
i am now with at & t .
the only item on the menu still good is the mexican pizza .
i have never seen anything like it .
i hope to return soon and update my review ( :
this is not a nightclub , right ?
one of the worst service experiences i 've ever had .
any hole in the wall chinese restaurant is better then this !
chips were good , but , they are chips ...
and one star for the apple martini ... the best part of my meal !
chorizo and egg burrito was very greasy .
why is this called a gourmet burger ? ? ? ? ?
i do n't think we 'll be heading back .
not really a good place to go and have your honda car fixed .
i got the spa pedicure and spa manicure .
it 's a little on the expensive side .
the metro busses in la are better than the greyhound busses actually .
they usually have nightly specials and drink specials in the bar .
i have n't been here in awhile and made a stop in last night .
was n't worth _num_ that 's for sure .
but the food certainly is not worth the visit .
we have a regular group that comes here every week ! !
beware - the mangers ' there listens to your concerns .
i 've been craving this place since then .
the atmosphere is good and i love the condiment bar .
we purchased a high end mattress that was delivered on may _num_ , _num_ .
they also forgot the ranch dressing that they charged me for !
this one is located in a not-so-great area of town .
i 'm going to have to say no .
to his mother for mother 's day .
i would n't comeback to this place ever ! !
the service was fast , friendly , and efficient .
the first meal i had with you completely exceeded my expectations .
the bread and honey butter is good .
the other competitors have a better selection .
if so , this is the place for you .
very pushy and not customer friendly at all !
but i can find that in my back yard .
it 's a good place to go out after work .
sashimi just so so , we had salmon and uni sashimi .
ok , a timeline i could deal with .
i was there on a weeknight , for over _num_ hours .
for sure they 've let the quality of service fade over the last few years .
its tough to describe ... ... ... .
records are fine but the owner is a complete asshole .
the cheesesteak barely had any meat or cheese .
the only good teacher she had was beau .
thanks to him , i 'll definitely return at some point in the future !
the service was n't great and the food was so-so .
the staff was very friendly and sociable , so that 's good .

i did n't get sick , though .
limited selection on anything other than the normal everyday vitamins or supplements .

i would not recommend this dentist office to anyone !
all i can say is this place is not even worth it
worst place in town by far ! !

they talk to you , over you and not with you .
i thought that bart was bad , and then i ride this .
the chicken and broccoli was not good !

i do n't recommend ordering anything `` fancier '' than that .

they do not have ice cream , only soft serve .
they have a good selection menu item .
pasta , pizza , salads , sandwiches .
-- overall the place is old and shabby , not maintained too well
i grew up going to this custard place as a kid .
very shady people and hard to deal with .

i will not do business with them again .
ordered just a philly chicken cheese steak .
i have used this groomer several times !
on top of that the food is n't really very good .
i found the quality of the product to be bad as well .
it 's next to something that resembles a scrap metal yard .
the selection is small and the prices are too high .
this is one of the worst customer services i have had in awhile .
the main reason for this is the service .

i was treated very well while i was there .

it was n't any better cold the next day .

well i was in madison late _num_ and decided on my last night
they once had the best patio in south charlotte .

i brought my dog in on a saturday for an emergency and no one was there .
i do not recommend this doctor 's office .

these guys are fast but that 's about it .
we have been going to golden canyon chinese for _num_ years .
this review is for the hooters restaurant in the casino .
just do n't count on getting any of the mail-in rebates that they offer , though .
it 's far but it 's worth the drive .
this place has decent modern/contemporary styles however there service is terrible .
took to another midas to fix - warranty .
do n't come here if you really enjoy mexican food .
it feels like i 've traveled back in time _num_ years .
the only good thing is the salsa bar .
i ca n't believe this place had good reviews ?
the senior pastor said god told him to buy a
i 'm not really sure what to think .
buffalo wild wings are way better than hooter 's wings .

oh well , not everything can be duplicated .
this place has them for $ _num_ each !
i vowed never again , and this time i mean it .
i get pizza at least once a week .
be prepared to spend _num_ $ a person .

used to come here years ago and loved it .
i asked for cheese on my eggs and bacon extra crispy .
i know it 's fast-food but the customs service is terrible ! ! !
my husband had the stacked enchiladas and he got a lot of food .

i 've tried the steaks , fish , chicken and duck .
called _num_ week before the flowers were to be delivered .
did a nuclear bomb take out short term parking ?
the chicken tortilla soup should be called tortilla soup .
they do n't know what they 're doing .
this is definitely not my go-to mexican restaurant .
it 's been like this for _num_ days and i have _num_ days to go .
i have to say this place is a bit overrated .
this was our first time here , and i 'm not sure we 'll be back .
it is a hole in the wall kind of place .
now i have to find a new mexican sit down restaurant .
the food was pretty good , depending on what you get .

my wife had the chile rellenos which she said were not good .
the service was wonderful and the server was very nice ,
he is a wonderful person and a great dentist .
we got the pulled pork and bbq chicken .
i usually like to have some left for lunch the next day .
this is a story about `` going the extra mile '' ...
the clothes are really expensive but cheap made .
i was not pleased at all with their customer service skills .
luckily i only have to go here once in a while .
and i 've seen reviews saying this is `` the best tres leches cake . ''
it 's not worth saving the money ! ! !
i visited this location around 9pm on a saturday night .
stayed here while in charlotte for a meeting .
i guess that 's what happens in vegas .
the store is very clean , and the staff is friendly .
i requested it to be toasted , it was not .
when we go back i will request not to sit in her section .
simple yet so difficult for this coffee house .
put all that aside , and the food still was n't that good .
this time i got the pimento and cheese sandwich with fries .
i have only dealt with the phoenix location .
will never be back to this high priced establishment ...

this office has the worst office staff ever !
i have eaten here on three different occasions .
i 've been here a few times and have always been disappointed .

if you are in vegas , there are a plethora of good restaurants .
the good : the ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful .
was greeted promptly and quickly shown to a table where we waited & waited & waited .
i 'm not a fan but i enjoy drinking at the bar area .
there are much better places in las vegas .
the ipa and hefeweizen were mediocre to poor .
they do n't even have the courtesy to answer .
it 's one of my favorite chinese food dishes .
i ordered a salad , steak , and mashed potatoes .
we left and went down the street to venezia 's .

this review is for my fellow moms and dads !
$ _num_ for all you can eat sushi .

embarrassed as i took clients and raved about the service and food .
our limo driver said he 'd get us in for `` free '' .
never will go back ... go to another place .
i 've ordered before and got nice flowers .
they do n't return phone calls when they say they will .

she was prompt at with refilling our ice tea , but not hovering .
i definitely would not recommend this dental group to any one .
soul food with no soul ... . thats my take on it .
then had to pay $ _num_ for a basket of fries .
the food was delicious and very reasonably priced .
is there something else in the room that needs a remote ? ?
if you need any body work , go elsewhere .
worse thai food i had in a while .
they said they 'd call me back for some unknown reason and never did .
the _num_ for $ _num_ deal is a great deal .
but the service and the wait staff are the absolute worst .
i did buy one book for $ _num_ .
time for a new pho place in north las vegas .
plus you leave and your hair and clothes smell like the restaurant .
at least my toddlers seem to like it ...
i would also recommend shopping around for price .
i 'm still craving thai ... and looking for a great place in central phoenix .
used to be one of my favorite places for brunch or dinner .
i have n't been here in a while & now i know why ... .
this was some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .

the gentlemen who took our order was very friendly and helpful .
the cheesecake is whipped ( i.e. , not good ) .
we were n't happy with it at all .
my friend and i split a pizza meal here and it was horrible .
their red bean ice cream is also only strawberry ice cream with red bean chunks .
purchased a gift certificate for my wife for mothers day .
? lets not even go there ... ... .
i 've been going here for many years .
quite possibly the worst service and seating arrangement known to mankind .
a bit small but you can still dance .
as an out-of-towner , i chose this church based on their reviews .
i wish i could get that meal back .
they do have a good selection of jerky n snacks .
really do n't like to shop here unless i have to .
they had great customer service and made my experience great ! ! !
the staff was friendly for the most part .
the lunch came and it was just fine .
my prime rib was so fatty i could n't eat it .
overall it just could have been a better experience .
i had lunch here with a friend recently .
my wife ordered the chicken parmesan with the sald bar .
all they were doing was talking and on the phone .
i do n't know why i keep ordering chicken egg foo yong from this place .
when i went to pick up my money , i was told it would be mailed .
this has to be the worst buffet in las vegas .
i will be taking my family there from now on : (
do not go to casino royale in vegas .
this place has great prices and a good selection of products .
my husband and i went here for a `` nice '' dinner .
the staff is really friendly as well and that 's always a plus .

though dr.balle seems really mellow , he is really all about the money .

we always have great service to go along with the great food .
i 'm no loving it ! ! ! !
this place is as expensive as starbucks coffee .
my husband had the hot dog which he said was `` alright '' .
not a good selection of beads in my opinion .
this was the first and only time i will ever go to this barber shop .
new glarus beers were on special wednesday nights , which is great .
the rice was cold and the beans were dry .
the job was completed in a timely manner , however my car was not fixed properly .
the staff is very attentive and it is very loud .
they are tasty and they have a variety .
there was an older woman and a younger woman working .
only because there the ones that take more time .
if this is really the best pizza in pittsburgh ... wow .
love the decor and space of this place .
but most of us still eat it once and a while .
the air unit had a mind of its own .
will not return and i live walking distance .
aside from that not worth it at all .
nice atmosphere , and the service was good ...
do n't let the castle exterior fool you .
ca n't say enough bad things about this place .
great location , good price and nice rooms .
took my ipad in to get the screen changed because of a crack in a screen .
this is hands down the worst breakfast place ever .
this casino is too far from my house , but i work within the area .
i was so relieved that she found them .
there are better chinese restaurants in the area .
but , one thing was the worst was the bathroom .
this was my first time using their services .
i will be taking this to the district manager .
i have never had a bad experience with the food here .
... but the tap beer selection is good .
mind you there was only one more customer in the shop being helped .
i had high expectations because i was told that it is better than chipotle and moes .
i 've been to ny and this is not ny style pizza .
the portions are n't very good for the price .
when i go back to pittsburg i will not be going there again ! ! !
the customer base here is very poor and very diverse .
their steaks are ok , but just ok. their fillet mignon is not a fillet mignon .
soda comes in a can , no soda fountain .
so sad , i used to have such a good time at these lanes .
its close , its cheap , and i like `` chinese '' food .
i 'm surprise how conservative the bar is .
i feel like this place is destined to be a place on restaurant impossible .
they had told me i would need _num_ crowns ( ! )
it was for a _num_ and did n't fit .
spend the extra money and get a cab .
leaky half nothing on the pizza.the hawaiin had no ham .
i was intrigued by the great reviews of pita house .
it is uncomfortable and gross sitting in a hot restaurant
it was n't very crowded for a saturday night , which is not surprising .
they did n't seem to be to busy .
how does this have _num_ stars on yelp ?
when i arrived , the place was in tip top shape !
no other lens rental place charges the price of the lens as a deposit .

the office was opened but the staff resented it .
this is probably the worst sheraton property out there .
-it does n't have a lot of good food and shop selections
the baby back pork ribs were good , and fell off the bone .
usually you expect the shredded beef to be , well.. shredded .
the hot and sour soup had peas ... peas !
took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner .
nobody else in my party enjoyed their food either .
if you care about your car , do n't go to this place .
we got him what he needed , and we were out !
it tasted like leftovers , not freshly cooked .

the price you pay for the amount of food you get is laughable .
most of us ordered off the lunch special menu .
i have been here several times and the food as always , phenomenal .
the store is very clean , and the staff is friendly .
( i went here in the summer of _num_ .
just not a great or big plate of food for the price .

took my daughter to get her first nose piercing .
i came here based on the awesome yelp reviews and was very disappointed .
customer service was awful and my car was n't even clean .
then housekeeping never came to clean the rooms .
if you are in the mood for italian , i would not pick this location .
all i have to say ... have a god blessed day .
more like peanut butter -- the peanut was overpowering .
it 's sucks because arizona lacks culture foods .
i have been a patient of the windmill/pecos clinic for years .
the lighting is dim , which can be romantic , and the decor is quaint .
and like any theater they have to have comfy seats for a 2hr movie .

they have great food if you can get service .
my husband and i go here every christmas .

very misleading we definently will not stay here again .
no 3-6 happy hour drinks ! ! ! ! !
$ .10- $ _num_ more expensive than other gas stations in the neighborhood .
how can you trust a mechanic like this ?
he does not care about his customers one bit , all he cares about is himself .
it had tons of flavor , i was really impressed with it .

they have a nice selection of draft beers .
pedicure was not that good and when he put the polish on it was horrible .
this used to be our go to place for out of town guests .
the sandwich was hot , fresh and tasty .
we have two yorkies and they are our service dogs .
this review is for the bar service at happy hour :
walgreens is walgreens : they have stuff you need and it 's convenient .
however , the atmosphere is nice and welcoming .
they will ask you if you are a hotel guest or not .
compared to other restaurants this is my least favorite .
and i went back to support a local business .

what did that have to do with anything. ? ? ?
food is suspect but service is very good .
every time i have to contact her it 's a pain .
this was one of the worst dining experiences of my life .

and i like my waffle cones crisp and crunchy not soft and chewy .
i 've lived in vegas , over two years .

the restaurant formerly known as the best hong kong .
- the mexican pizza was soggy and chewy ( no , not in a good way )
if you do n't you wo n't get any .

not the type of service i would expect .
as top-notch restaurants entered the market , the local palates grew up in a big way .
i ordered a sandwich and some pancakes/hash browns for my daughter .

she 's at least in her 50s or so .
dana was our server and she was just terrible !

i ca n't believe this place is in business .
they had the front door open with two dogs in the back .
woman behind the counter looked miserable did n't smile once .
they had no hot sauce other than tabasco .

spaghettie warehouse server will just spilled my meal on the floor and it spilled all over my coat .

albeit , they 've lowered their prices but also lowered the quality of food .
all i have to say ... have a god blessed day .
they forgot the smog test.. on top of that internet was down .
the brown , soggy fries were pretty awful .
we had visited the place during 4th july weekend .

i had made a reservation for a later time than i wanted for dinner through open table .
we will not be going back to this place .
as for the pork vermicelli , the noodles were sticky and tasted a day old .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
this office has a lot going for it .
we were hoping for diamonds in the rough .
we had the pork egg roll , egg drop soup and hot and sour soup .
my business and my family cars will certainly will not come back here .
another in our party had the eggplant parm .
it worked out fine and the dessert was great .
also it 's a cash only place but they do have an atm .
i ca n't even fathom what the wait is without a appt .
i love supporting local businesses but this pizza place will not be visited again .
lastly , while there is a baby changer in the bathroom , it is placed high .

had two dishes : chicken makhani and a saag dish .
the staff was friendly and the service was great !
it 's convenient for lunch from my work but i would n't go out of my way .
the only reason to go here is that it is close to asu tempe campus .

with an expanded menu , this would easily be _num_ stars .
this was the worst mexican food i 've ever had ! !

if somebody invites you here , no problem .
mongolian beef is not mongolian beef at all !
the farmer 's market store is very expensive .
this place was really disappointing as far as how much they beat you for money .

no one went above and beyond to make me and my fianc feel welcomed .
i do n't dine in at this place , i either take out or get delivery .

order to go because they are close to the house .
you can tell the ingredients were not fresh .
service was outstanding but we will never go back .
`` diners , drive in 's and dives . ''
went there 3/1/2014 with my _num_ kids and had a horrible experience .
looking at other review sites , this is not the company i want .

i do like the name of the place , of course .
they 've gotten my order wrong every time !

from the quality of their food to their prices .

the pizza had lots of cheese but very little flavor .
we were given the coldest look when we came in .
+++++++at their deli counter they charge a $ _num_ more than fry's+++++++
they have knowledgeable teachers for every skill level for a decent price .
that 's all i 've got to say .
you 'll leave feeling like you ate nothing at all .
they do there best at what they do !
if not for the texas toast , i would have left very hungry .
i always expect the freshest ingredients from chipotle :
guess it 's a trickle-down attitude ... lots of choices here , but all meh .
my son : _num_ ; daughter : _num_ years old .
i love buffalo wild wings just not this location .
save your money for the real eiffel tower .
i had never had any problems with that .

i 'll order from val vista next time .
had this chicken on more than one occasion .
the silver lining ... the valet guy was super nice .
along with the soup i ordered the reuben sandwich .
i believe the lunch specials were around $ _num_ .
i have been to liberty market a few times .
the people that love it really love it .
the food was good as usual , as was the service .
the food is not that great and it is the priciest vietnamese restaurant in town .
just go for the shakes not the food .
we will be using ups from now on .
you get a ton of food for the price , but the staff .
it was like stepping back in time ... and not a good time .
every time i go , they always forget something !
the decor is gorgeous they put a lot of effort into it .
this place looks like a hole in the wall and it is .
it tasted like i had made it at home myself .
it 's great in the summer , but very uncomfortable in the winter .
maintenence is great but other than that i would not recommend .
mimi 's used to be one of my favorite places to go for lunch .
it does not have to be this way .
they do n't even have happy hour or any drink specials .
i have to update my review for this .
it 's also nice that they have shot clinics for your dogs .
we arrived and it was a beautiful morning .
the service is excellent though and all the memorabilia on the walls are fun too look at .
the situation at the door just was n't handled very well .
one positive : the service was friendly and responsive .
they were n't out , they do n't carry them .
the managers did n't seem to be bothered by it .
the only thing this place has is free wifi .
the back patio is great for people watching and just relaxing with friends .
their steaks are ok , but just ok. their fillet mignon is not a fillet mignon .
the price is n't worth it for the quality or quantity .
do n't expect state of the art slots .
just wanted them slimmed down and they wanted $ _num_ !
not that i really like nascar , i 'm just saying .
was it the best steak i 've ever had ?
they extracted a tooth that needed to be replaced with an implant .
i recently came back from vegas for a bachelor party .
that is the only good thing about this place .
i 've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff .
as soon as you walk in , the host is a b**** .
i had the beef ribs , collards , and mashed potatoes .
will not recommend to my friends and family .
i 've been to ny and this is not ny style pizza .
i came here for some tour a few years ago .
not the most labor-intensive order , but it still took about _num_ minutes .
$ _num_ would be more than fair for what we got .
they have everything you need at this store ...
if you need any body work , go elsewhere .
had a couple of libations ... . not impressed .
bolts and bolts of fabric on hanging rolls .
had to walk a county mile to get ice
this place was old and i will definitely not be going back .
if you need a place to stay in vegas , this fits the bill .
we called his surgeon and he wanted him in at the e. r. immediately. ``
i grabbed a seat at the bar , the bartender was fine ( cory ? )
the servers were nice and the food came quickly though .
located at the biltmore fashion park , parking is usually an issue .
this is where you bring your kids to have sit down pizza .
i used to love this place when hector owned it .
i upgraded to a suite & honestly it looked like a regular room .
the dining experience was terrible ! ! ! !
that is not how this dessert , one of my personal favourites , is meant to be .
they do not have a ton of staff .
not sure if we just do n't have a taste for smoked prime rib ...
i checked the ratings on yelp before visiting this place .
to say she is rude would be the understatement of the year .
the food was awsome , i had the beef tenderloin which melted in my mouth .
have never had a pleasant experience at this location .
also , kind of on the expensive side considering it 's a `` fast causal '' type place .
i heard this place was great when it first opened .
i have had much better service and much better food at other red lobster restaurants before .
we give this place a _num_ out of _num_ .
if i could rate _num_ stars , i would .
i 've shopped here several times too many .
the pizza looked hella fresh , but tasted hella yucky !
will not being going back or recommending it to anyone .
you go for the adventure of it but not the food .
they are up front and willing to work with you .
do n't get me wrong , this is an interesting place with lots of character .
i brought my daughter all dressed and ready to her first class .
as for the facility , clean and organized .
i went in for a _num_ oil change and they never changed he oil .
this is by far the worst chinese place in charlotte .
if you want friendly staff this is n't the spot .
lots of other pizza places in the burgh .
2-hour wait and it seems like a norm here .
they fried the cheapest fish , not even tilapia .
i am going to find a new place to enjoy my cup of joe .
it 's a nice place to study or pick up a cup of coffee .

i am not sure about the variety of the rooms .
probably one of the worst indian food i have ever had in usa .
would n't recommend right off gate from our initial phone conversation .
it 's tasting good and you 're feeling like a red blooded american .
then , i tried paying online , but you can only pay online with a check .
course was in horrible condition , the back _num_ tee boxes fairways and greens were like hitting on concrete .
however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
it 's very close to the movie theater so good for a date night !
they are better priced and do an amazing job .

i 'm going as far away as i can from you !
go here with out of town guests but not for a nice evening out .
the food is good , but the service is n't .
we had the scallops wrapped in bacon which was too salty even with the maple on it .
and they usually have some great deals on those , so be sure to check that out .
the guy who served us was cool beans though .
i ordered carne asada chips but got carne asada fries .
great atmosphere , awesome selection of wines , and live music .
so i asked for two pints , nope , out of pints too .
great selection and customer service , that is until i visited ardys ace on tatum and tbird .
it was a bit of a drive but i made it .
specializing in breakfast , i 'd think it would have been better .
when it 's like that , this place is now not on the top of my list .
so my advice is = call before making a trip to the shop .
we had the grilled chicken sandwich , pizza , and a burger .
i thought this was a professional and trustworthy company , it 's far from it ! !
currently waiting for my maintenance request to be completed after submitting it _num_ days ago .
i had the hardest time trying to find the meat .
it 's a good place to go out after work .

i do n't get my car cleaned ( inside ) on a regular basis .
they had a really great special on sundays ( $ _num_ for _num_ wings and 32oz of beer ) .

to be fair , the atmosphere is really fun and intimate .
respect and courtesy was n't their strong suit on this beautiful saturday .
i would not refer anyone to this car lot .
i tried breakfast , lunch , and dinner ! !
they have this huge fruity alcoholic that 's fun to share .
on the upside , the staff is friendly and always smiling .
the girls up at the front and the vet techs were all super friendly and sweet .
i 've only been here on a friday or saturday night .
i felt rushed through my meal and dining experience .
i got the _num_ '' and was n't very impressed .
i took my car here to have the left rear catalytic converter replaced .
just to get our check was like pulling teeth .
for my choice of side i went with fries .
perhaps i should n't have gone to crane alley hungry .

the pizza is great , and wings are pretty good too .
the food here is `` hit or miss . ''
worst service i have ever seen in my life .
this place has the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
if you 're looking for a good seafood buffet this is not the place for you .
the noodles were not good and the sauce was tasteless .
because of that , i go here every three months or so .
the only good thing is that the drinks are cheap .
i do n't recommend this to anyone looking for either a meal , or a deal .
i immediately went to the front desk and she gave me another room .
i 've taken things here a few times over the years .
go for the pedicures if you live in the area .

, but bad food ( fake crab in crab rangoon !
every time i go , they always forget something !
the food was also tasty and the owners/employees were very friendly and helpful .
the chicken tortilla soup should be called tortilla soup .
seems like every couple months the portions get smaller , and the prices go up .

i was n't super impressed with the india palace buffet .
i had a bite of a chocolate torte , and was very impressed .
i used to come here for the sos which was as good as i ever had .

all i ordered was chicken fried rice , and chicken wings .
from the minute you drive up to the minute you leave the experience is horrendous .
went here with my bride to celebrate our 20th anniversary .
i would not recommend this to anyone if you are in the mood for good food .
me : how long do i have to wait ?
the hostess/waitress was stained with food from head to toe .
it 's not fine dining if you have to tell people it 's fine dining .
the atmosphere was great and it was reasonably priced .

this place has a great location and great ambience .
the mushroom pizza as an appetizer was very average .
this cake was awful , from the frosting to the cake .
it was always i nice laided back place with a great atmosphere .
we sat there , they all sang and walked away .
i just keeping asking `` what happened to the food ? ''
the food was good , but there are definitely better mexican food places in town .
about three times they told me that they `` guarantee their work '' .
they recently renovated rooms but should have renovated management and staff .
i guarantee i will not be back next year .
this place has been around for a very long time and you can tell .
if you are looking for something retro ( but new ) this is not it .
( in my eyes and taste buds at least ) .
more like a railroad apartment , without doors to separate the bedroom from the living room .
the service was great but the food was not .
pizza and chicken was cold even though it 's _num_ outside .
it 's been awhile i have n't been here .
he told me that was not one of the main side effects .
it was not pleasing to the eye or palate .
if you are looking to fill up go for it .
i think hotels or condos should be somewhat quiet .
in our opinion , the pizza contained a lot of bread and very little of everything else .
i grabbed my husband and we beelined out of there .
i highly recommend that if you are looking for medical care , do not go there !
this was all at the west side location , and i hear the east side is even worse .
my friend and i definitely were not satisfied with the service or sandwich .
and , it 's more expensive than most coffee shops .
we got a concrete with reese 's peanut cup .
dignity ... that 's exactly what they take from you .
i was really disappointed with the way the staff treats the customers .

if you 're a guy this is the place to go to get a screwed up haircut .
i ordered the queso with chips on 09/13/15 at about 6:30pm .
... especially considering they 're not all that great .
very nice guy , did n't catch his name .
i called in so i would n't have to wait .
do n't come here if you really wan na just get something to eat .
however , loved the atmosphere and the service was top notch .
this is n't even the cheapest place in town so i just do n't get it .
i had the _num_ inch blt with the garlic sauce and a side of potato salad .
this is by far the worse chinese food i 've ever had .
i have been dealing with a bathroom vanity since thanksgiving .
went up to vegas to help my son move back to his old home .
in town to go to dinner with my kids and family .
and the school supplies were all over the store .
this place reminded me of eating in a thrift store .
you tried , but it 's not the same .
i 've been going to this place for years .
i 'm not sure what 's going on with flavors of india .
the food is , unfortunately , not very well prepared .
saw one of the cast members from the tv show
the prices , however , ca n't be beat .
i do n't know how they stay in business now .
again , good for the location and that is as far as i would go .
we ordered our food and _num_ minutes later we still did not have our food .
the food is not the question , the food is phenomenal .
but as far as the food goes it was pretty average .
she also told me if i do n't like it do n't come back .
the tiramisu was probably the worst tiramisu i 've ever had .
it makes it very hard to shop around the store .
now , the receptionists at the front desk are extremely rude ! ! !
even though it was skipping gears and shifting really slow .
expensive and not that good ..the food is kind of bland .
but the curds are not the traditional curds , they were fried curds , like fried mozzarella .
ive ate many tacos in mexico and this tacos are way to small
been to many good mexican restaurants in the phoenix area .
i was one of the lucky ones who got food poisoning .
i even had gravy on the side , so it was n't soggy from the gravy .
good location - about _num_ minutes driving distance to old town .
the wait time is longer than _num_ freaking hours !
we were seated as soon as we got there .
there is always a sale and they often run kohl 's cash promotions .
we ordered a pitcher of margaritas and were disappointed there as well .
if you have a family , this place is awesome because there is always something to do !
there is a lot of other options out there for you to try instead .
husband and i are in from out of town .

my first impression was that the dining room was extremely small and crowded .

i ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp .
the best part is the cookie dough and the ambiance .

rv parks are always defined by their price and their `` amenities '' .
( they were on the menu , so it 's not like i made a special order ) .

the line is backed up an there 's only one teller .
definitely will not come back to this one ever again .
the greens are mediocre and the mac and cheese is just sad !

but you can get a room for $ _num_ sometimes !
i had my wedding dress altered here and it was done efficiently and well priced .
next we had the tunacado , the scallop dynamite roll and the chili ponzu yellowtail .
this used to be one of my favorite places to eat .
there was a dance floor ... but only one couple could dance at a time ...
you order at the counter and they bring it out to you , but it is not a full service restaurant .
it took even longer to get our food ; it was n't even worth the wait .
their muffins , on the other hand , are great .

i 'm from san diego , customer service not to good ...
good place to watch the game probably ( bar ) .
as usual , the moving walkways are n't working either .
just because this place was on diners , drive-ins and dives , does n't mean its `` all-that '' .

but this location ca n't compare to the others i 've been to .
this is one of the very few food places near where we live .
i love the fact that they are open _num_ hours !
the ice cream was ice cream when you want it .
you can hardly see the stage and the sound is terrible .
on top of that , their hours are all over the place .
i love supporting local business , but this was a terrible experience for mediocre food .
let me do something different for this review because there were so many things wrong :
this place is dirty i feel like my food was recycled .
there 's only a starbucks , a wendy 's , and blue burrito as eating options .
this place could not last in any other major city .
i wo n't be going back so if you 're looking for a understanding compassionate doctor she is not the one .
if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .
they were not busy at all for a saturday night .
i ordered the ginger chicken thinking that it would warm me up on a cold day .
the vet we went to was deer creek animal hospital .
we really liked the vets they had , but had not so great experiences with the new vets .
my mother will never be taken back to this office ever again .
got the blue corn enchiladas , there was no sauce so the chicken was dry .
i also do not want to offend anyone who honestly enjoys the food here .
i would not come back even if i was paid to !

i had the meatloaf and it was not so good .
never go here if you want to be treated with respect

i use to bring my dog in all the time to be groomed .
i did like their cocktail de camaron but nothing special .
the ice cream looked great but i did n't try it .
this was the worst sushi place i have been to .
if i 'm paying a premium fee , i expect to be treated much much better .
the only thing good about this place is the service .
no way are they that busy that early in the mornings .
one with mushroom and olives and the other with just peperoni .
the food is not prepared as well as the other locations .
the food was good , but the overall experience was disappointing ...
i 've found them in the cleaning aisle and the hardware aisle .
in all , this is not my type of place .
the only good thing is their clearance sections where they have a few decent deals sometimes .
the most upsetting set of acrylic gels nails i have ever paid _num_ for .
the neon sign is kind of cool , but there are neon signs everywhere !
the bar area and bartender were friendly and attentive : ) so that part was great !
i brought my _num_ ci in for the airbag recall , the service dept conducted a _num_ point maintenance check as well .
the fireball pork sandwich used to be awesome , tonight it was a pork chop , definitely not pork tenderloin .
my husband took my car here over the weekend for the first and last time !
the rooms all come with a microwave , stove and a fridge .
it 's a shame cuz it 's a nice place .
however , they do like to tell you a story and sell you stuff more than you need .
so it seems like this target is a bit on the ghetto side .
the place would do so much better with a little remodeling !
i like watching the show cause i like fish and the cool designs they do .
i ordered a strawberry margarita and found that a strawberry had never been near it .
if this is any glimpse of the future it 's not a good one .

i do not trust this company ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
so thank you ricky for ruining what could have been a great meal .
i would recommend everyone to try the worst chinese food in las vegas .

tried this place because i was referred by a friend .
my worst experience so far was at the fragrance counter .
the holiday inn express hotels are far better than this holiday inn .

in my opinion , sing sing is really not worth it .
they only take appointments for two days ahead , but you have to go on line to do it -- - wtf ?

i do n't recommend the wing bar , not worth it .
although they have great party items , i would never stop there again !

it is a big airport and it 's not easy to navigate .
cook in the kitchen do n't know how to cook steak .
this used to be one of my favorite spots to meet up with friends .
i 'm not sure why anyone would want to venture off the strip for this lackluster experience .

overall it was delicious , but nothing like i expected .

this popeyes used to be one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite .
do n't try to reach out to me again , dillon 's .
on my last _num_ visits it was for over $ _num_ .
unfortunately i ordered a grilled chicken salad and my chicken was raw .
the place was packed with people and we could not even get into the auditorium .
this place has ok food , would come here because it was closer to me .
wish i could post a pic but it 's not giving me an option .
it would have been nice had they told me that when i dropped them off .
i would n't recommend this place if you 're looking for italian food .
there are only two places that i recommend for thai food in the area ; thai basil and thai elephant .
had hair in the pho , and messed up our orders .
i saw _num_ different people and none of them could help me .
plan to wait for hours to see her , if she 's there at all .
but why is the door so close to the salad bar ?
take a chance with this economy to buy private party .
this is , certainly , not a place i would recommend .
she was so dumb and did not seem like she knew what she was doing .
we had an emergency leak and as they advertised - 24/7 emergency service we called them .

so it 's been awhile since my last visit here .
the surrounding area is run down with no other businesses in the area .
my fiance , our friend and i went here because they were hungry .
they rush you out and do n't do a good job .
i went to this place because it was highly recommended my friends and coworkers .
not only do you have to wait at least _num_ minutes in line but you get the wrong food .
the only thing that distinguishes one dish from the other is the texture ... each item has the same bland taste .
the only reason that i gave them _num_ stars is because of the service .
biggest plus - the chips are hot fresh and the salsas are tasty .
he asked me ' when will you worry about it then ?
it was busy but at times could n't find her .
i did enjoy the rice and beans on the side .
i 've been coming here for years and the food has always been good the prices fair and the service exceptional .
i really hope management reads and listens to these reviews .
one of entrees smelled like lighter fluid and was inedible .
headed to try this place for the first time tonight .
the bad : the service was bad from the front of the house to the back .
the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service .
what i ended up with was not what i expected .
i like that it 's right downtown by my house .
the only good things about this hotel-casino are that it is cheap and it has a great location on the strip .

but what prompted me to write a review is my experience last night .
as far as i could tell each customer was treated this way .
the food is generally very good at this village tavern .
i will advise my friends and family not to visit this salon .
my review is based on the look and feel of the location .
it was about $ _num_ and some change for an order of _num_ rolls .
food and drinks are always good and prices are reasonable .
the rice pilaf was actually spanish rice and it was dry .
this restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance .
chicago pizza- they obviously have never had a chicago pizza .
sat on patio , tables and chairs way to close .
the decor is standard but the food is pretty average .
i wish i had treated her to any other nail salon but this one !
nando 's has good food , however their service is slow .
i was visiting phoenix and we came here for my brother 's birthday .
ok , so this place is literally a big tin shed , but that 's not the issue .
this was one of the worst experiences my friends and i have had .
i like the menu for dennys however this particular dennys is not that great .
first of all , you have to wait in the same line as the customers eating in .
if you have an emergency , it 's a huge problem , they do n't respond .
my girlfriend got a chicken dish , which was n't any better .
we stopped in for a late night snack on the way back to the hotel .
it makes a lot of sense why cousins subs keep going out of business ! !
every time i 've been here the food has been great .
when i ask for something to be held i expect to have it held .
the $ _num_ ruben ruben is a good sized sandwich with dry and un-flavorful pastrami .

this is a place i 'd go to just for the games .
they took out all the live table games and dealers .
cheese wiz was good but who am i kidding cheese wiz is always good .

wow i have never put as much into local bar as this place .
he said that he was the owner of the company and that he makes the decisions .
i tried to place a to go order tonight at 7:30pm .
when i arrived i was greeted by a wonderful smile .
never go here if you want to be treated with respect
we just moved less than a mile away from this location .
would probably not go back there again but was worth the experience for the view .
the rest of the table was now finished with their food .
with all of the mexican food options in phoenix , there is no reason to come here .
seriously , if you do n't have anything nice to say , please do n't say anything .
the very best hotel downtown and the best pool in vegas that 's the good .
if you need to `` go '' , `` go '' some place else .
nice location in the venetian , but i would n't eat there again .
indeed , my belly was full -- full of bread .
ordering over the phone is easy- but when you get there to pick it up- it 's a total joke .

now i have to pay another $ _num_ to go somewhere else and get it fixed .
this place has all the razzle dazzle you expect in vegas .
this is not a gourmet restaurant , but it has a gourmet menu .

guess my wife and i will have to find ourselves a new favorite .
we have stayed here a few times and had a good experience .
we came here after a night out for q quick bite and the service was horrible !
by far not one of the best places i 've been to .
i have never experienced customer service like i just did .
the only good thing is the view of north mountain .

the salsa was crap and there was no chile verde .
pricey , my dish was $ _num_ for black cod baked in a bag .
the place looks very nice , the staff is very friendly .
i tried the maguro , shrimp tempura , and the tempura eel roll .
they need to work on the quality of the food and their service .

check this place out to see if you like it .
it almost feels like they 're trying to cut corners .
my girls & i got our hair cut , colored & styled with _num_ different stylist and neither of us like it .
it was the worst service we have ever received at chills .
i had the battery of my watch replaced here today .

my dad and uncle both ordered their steaks medium well and they came out medium rare .
my filet was had a good flavor but was a little tough .
$ _num_ beer , a party atmosphere and free food during happy hour .
the food is decent , for the hours they 're open .
their breadsticks and soups are good , but that 's about it .
i 'm not sure what all the rave reviews for this place are about .
it was rice with some meat and a spicy sauce .

i called at _num_ and they said it would be delivered in _num_ minutes .

if you know the waitress , you can walk in and sit anywhere you want .
for example , they offer the reuben sandwich for meat eaters and the sheldon for vegetarians .
i have been to many thai restaurants and i usually always rate a thai place by their pad thai .
the clothes and accessories are way overpriced for what you 're getting !
nice location that it 's close to the strip and it 's easy to walk around .
def the cheapest ( quality wise ) pizza in town .
i would never review a mcdonald 's normally , but i have to review this one because its so disgusting .
egg rolls , spring rolls , shrimp paste , and even the tea is really good .
the bar is usually crowded with riff raff and the staff has been not helpful on many occasions .
on 3/29/15 , my credit card tip of $ _num_ was changed to $ _num_ .

the food is pretty good for a fast food restaurant .
this last visit i never got a chance to eat .
but , for what it is ... ... it 's just fine .

the eggplant was good , but was saltier and more sour than i was expecting .
the shopping center this store is located in is small and the parking lots is always cramped and crowded .
by the time our food made it to the table our son had almost finished his .
i think the wifi was free , but could n't get it to work , so who knows .
what this place lacks in quality , should be made up for in ease .
they removed the nam prik nam pla or thai chilis in fish sauce from their spice tray , and refuse to bring it back when asked .
decent beer selection , but i would n't go there for just the beer , need to have good food too .
i do n't feel like the meal was worth any where near that .
the dress has a lace overlay , and i was told they would fix any picks in the lace .
we used to love rosati 's , but i guess their new ownership does n't get it .
all the repair person did was try to up sell me on services that i did not need !
there were hardly any choice in the appetizer selection and very limited options for vegetarian palate .
i would n't recommend this place if you 're looking for italian food .
when we got our food , we had to constantly blow on it because it was piping hot !
went here saturday after a long absence and was reminded why there has been such a long absence .
i had general tao 's chicken w fried rice , and the chicken was n't chicken ... .
but we were told it would take half an hour to deliver , it took an hour .
although the food was tasty the service made me never wan na ever wan na go back .
the service was good ; we were seated right away and the wait staff was attentive .
from weak coffee to almost no blueberries ( one found ) in their blueberry muffins .
i ordered the `` signature martini '' and it was the worse martini i 've ever had .
i have eaten mexican food on the streets of tijuana and almost never has it been this bad .
located right next to pnc park , so is a decent place to get a beer and some grub prior to game day .
the sides were nothing special , we had asparagus , mushrooms , whipped potatoes and creamed spinach .
weights can get hectic like anywhere , but apparently my gym membership is n't always valid enough to use the plyometrics equipment and kettlebells .
i 've been up all night puking because of this place ! ! !
as we waited on line the place got even busier and things fell apart from there .
tho the price is cheap and the service is lightning fast the food does not stack up .
they are never ever on time ever whatever time you get add an extra hour to the estimated time .
this place breaks your car so you have to go back to them !
went here a couple of years ago and immediately was n't too thrilled with the place .
not a huge fan of their coffee , the cookies and pastries are really good , however !
if you like trying new things , it 's not a bad idea to give this place a try .
the kung pao chicken was disappointing and the beef fried rice had a strange flavor .
the dealers were ok , but the craps pit bosses were the rudest i 've ever encountered and made the experience horrendous .
( after we had a great dinner at rustlers rooste , with a long shuttle wait before and after our meal )
this is not the case at this particular location in the scottsdale fashion square .
maybe they should close down for a week and scrub down the place .
this place reminds me of my grandma 's cooking ... and my grandma ca n't cook .
the day after i posted my review , my husband , who was _num_ years old , passed away .
they use to have a few quality barbers now they have all left !
the food credit also requires you to sign up for their rewards club .
i called them after waiting about _num_ minutes , sure that they had forgotten about me .
i used to do all my grocery shopping at trader joe 's , but this location is just awful .
for the amount of food you get , the prices are a bit high .
patio is nice during the summertime , but service is not the greatest out there .
this is a bit out of the way because you have to go north of sahara to get to it and then back to go west on sahara .
this is the hamilton branch of a chandler library , and literally right inside hamilton high school .
so when i had the opportunity to eat at this one i was glad ... ... ..
i do n't mind paying premium prices for a good meal , but it 's not that impressive .
the setting is very romantic and the way the seating is set up makes it a more intimate setting .
it seems when i want it done correctly i end up having to complain to them that they never do it right .
did n't help that they forget to put in the order to actually make my sandwich .
definitely one of those `` get what you need and get out '' .
my guess is that they burned something in the wok before they cooked ours and did n't clean it out .
we both had the cinnamon roll french toast combo ... . with eggs and bacon for me .
i showed up just before my appointment time and was greeted by the receptionist .
i 've been to many chinese restaurants , and this was by far not the best experience i 've had .
this is one of the few local joints i wo n't come back to .
i 'm not sure if my upset stomach is my mindset or bad food .
the service was fine and our server made sure our drinks were always full .
they are rude and always make you feel like they are doing you a favor .
if you 're on a budget , however , this is your place .
after hearing so many good things about this place , i finally got a chance to go there and i was so disappointed .
in the last few years i 've tried my best to like this place .
we had the prime rib sandwich , and an order of chicken wings .
the prize box arcade machine is excellent and easy to do to receive prize .
i ca n't wait until they install my glass so i do n't have to deal with them again .
i 've been here a few times since the initial review and the food has been marginal .
there 's a lot of variety of flavors and you can even ask to sample a few before you buy .
the servers knew the names of the customers and treated them like they were part of the family .
i have been here a few times and every time i regret it .
it is a staple of the city of chandler , and it is surrounded by beautiful large custom homes .
it 's a nice place to study or pick up a cup of coffee .
ive been coming here for _num_ years and used to love this place .
just make sure that you have a bit of extra time to make sure that your food is as you ordered it .
i hear of packed nights , but i guess it is only during certain hours .
if you do go stay away from the specials and be prepared to pay quite a bit .
also got the shrimp adriatico which taste like plain shrimp as the sauce was too thin to coat the shrimp .
there is almost no reason to go to bww unless you 're jonesing to play ntn trivia .
the teri chix was not marinated- instead just some sticky teri sauce was globbed over it .
the ambiance is pretty nice , especially in the private dining rooms and the library for members .
no wonder the fry 's across the street is always packed and this place is n't ... lost my business forever ...
that 's as sure as the sun rising in the east and setting in the west .
i 'm not sure about their pizza , but i 'm not too confident it 's better than the places i currently order from .
$ _num_ compared to $ _num_ , and $ _num_ compared to $ _num_ .
he then walked me back and helped me find exactly what i was looking for .
i asked if they took my insurance and the woman told me i would have to call my insurance company and get back to her .
although $ _num_ beer pints for happy hour is great the food is just not that good .
after such good reviews on yelp , i went to try this out .
what sort of fried chicken fast food joint does n't have a spicy chicken option ?
it 's very hard to find some of these things and i was so excited to find that they had them .
there 's got to be a better place on this side of town ? ?
this evening , i had a lovely dinner , good food , good service , nice table .
i do n't remember a time i was able to relax and enjoy a meal here .
my husband and i finally saved up enough money to buy a really nice set .
went to red devil with a few friends to experience their wings and pizza .
as far as the food goes , i love their honey mustard salad dressing , and their salads are crisp , fresh , and the croutons were delicious !

the food here is pretty good but not the best i 've ever had .

i had been told about his place by coworkers and decided to take my parents , wife and _num_ year old out for the `` best burger '' .

most of the activities were open , if not all , and there were no crowds .
i am willing to drive to the other locations just to avoid it .
i hate to say it but i 've had a better slice of prime rib at black angus !
so , i had been wanting to try this place for some time .
if you just want the downtown chandler experience , i recommend one of the other restaurants .
i wanted to like them since i enjoy supporting local businesses , but seems like they want the folks who are too cool for school .
i understand that this place is an old classic , but it seems more old than classic at this point .
this time i had to check to make sure i was in the right place .
_num_ hour later we go to ask about our lane because the people that came in after us got their lane .
they definitely showed me they do not care about our health and just care about there money .
we were touring and just wanted to have a good time , but they do n't even offer free drinks there .
my usually favorite cookie dough flavored master blast has been made with dried out nuggets of cookie dough .

there are too many very good restaurants within walking distance of this place .
i chose my color for the main color , not the tip , i wanted white tips and she started with the tips another color .

the mandatory helmets and neck braces are filthy and in disrepair ( broken straps , cracked helmets ) .
i 'm very disappointed with the lack of customer service at this place .
on the other end , we orderd a toro dish that was the worst toro i 've had .
it was pretty good , so we decided to go in and eat .
in fact i have referred many family and friends here ... not a good idea .
if you 're thinking about going here , do yourself a favor and do n't .
leasing staff do n't get anything done and are doing personal stuff while supposed to be in the office .
do n't go between 430-730pm though because you will never get on a machine or the equipment .
anyway i would n't recommend going there if you have a non-sushi eater at your table .
the girl who took the order over the phone was very helpful and nice .

if you drink they have good happy hour specials but that 's about it .
they 're a bit on the expensive side , but the pizza was great .

my advice for tisun ... come to _num_ and invest in a security camera like every other store on earth !

i would have let that go but then i get home and find that they also had not put the avocado in it .
yes , its an old fashion ice cream parlor , good ice cream and presentation but definitely not worth the drive .
when i did not get a discount this last time and asked why , i was told that i would have had to ask for the senior discount before i paid .

i do n't know how to describe the taste exactly , but i clearly remember that it did n't taste natural or right .
: / so if you are like myself and enjoy fresh ingredients , do yourself a favor and run !
wrong arrangement delivered , and on top of that , they left out the large roses that the arrangement should have included .
they told me they could n't put the mustard on for me but could give me a packet and i could put it on .
the front desk was reasonably nice but it took me several trips to the front desk and phone calls to house keeping to get a damn room service menu .
overall it was a pretty bad first impression , but by the end of the night i was satisfied .
it was n't bad , per se , but there are so many amazing restaurants in vegas , that this one really is n't worth a second shot .
i would n't go out of my way to come here , but it 's useful for when i 'm in the area .
the sandwich did n't really have much flavor and i would have rather just had the fries on the side with some malt vinegar .
when i went , it was hard to get the attention of the staff when i had a question .
it 's also not exactly where google maps says that it 's located , so it 's a bit difficult to find .

food she had to ring it up again , so i ask to talk to the manger cause for one he never came by to say i apologize for that r anything , he walk pass us twice ( did not know it was him till i told the server to get the manager smh ) when he came over n i told him about the hair all he said was stuff like that happen ! ! ! !
anyone who has allergies and wants ordered food accordingly do n't go here as they do n't make the order correctly and what you get home and open your order up and see it is made wrong and you call them and they say that next time you come in it will be replaced and you have the receipt with name of person you spoke to and they even write it in the office book do n't expect it to actually happen and you will sit forever to find this out when they have maybe _num_ or _num_ customers .
stayed at the paint counter for nearly _num_ minutes and the woman walked past us _num_ or _num_ times , even asked me to pick up a _num_ gallon bucket so she could read a label , then continue to do whatever it was she was doing .
our server seemed out of it , she could n't seem to remember our drink orders even though we were just a table of two and there were only _num_ or _num_ other tables seated in her section , and come on its a buffet so bringing the drinks is about the only thing they have to do .
and we made our dinner orders when we ordered our drinks and we got our appetizers on time and waited forever for our food and come to find out by a new server that took over , that our order was never put in and that she would buy us dessert and she had told the cooks to rush and make our food .
worst service ever and so disrespectful and no regards for patient care and alot of them should get charged with negligence , so i hope you are never get hurt and have to go there because it will be your worst experience ever and definitely the place to go to learn what not to do , so be careful and watch and ask what they are doing to you and do n't be afraid to ask for someone else.the people on the ground floor and by the entrance should be better then they are and are giving umc and worse name because they are the people you see when you walk in and they are giving you a bad image , i even filed a complaint with the patient relations office and they were just as rude.i do n't not recommend this place , unless you dying ... then transfer as soon as you can !
ate here _num_ or _num_ years ago on my birthday and i was thinking it was going to be like the hooters in arizona which i loved going to when i was in college beautiful woman good food the works but i did n't get that here sure the woman were beautiful and they have different tvs to watch sports but the food here was not good i ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and the curly fries with a soda and i think a cake or shake afterwards the fries were old and stale the cake or whatever desert i got was dry the only decent thing was the sandwich the customer service was n't really all that good as the lady did n't check on me that much overall it was a disaster and the whole inside of the casino is just blah and it seems since the last time i went nothing really has changed overall this one bad experience has changed my mind about coming here again overall which sucks because hooters was at one time one of my favorite restaurants to eat at and relax and catch the games at .
