for the prices , go to capital grille !
their wings are pretty tasty , but the pizza is mediocre at best .
bland , uninspired and came cold to boot .

from the moment we walked in , this place felt different .
this really is n't a place where you should try something new .
i was here last weekend and i was very disappointed .
this used to be one of my favorite places to eat .
and the shuttles are not as frequent as they could be .
service is mediocre and the people there are very rude .
( with tip , as its not his fault his job sucks . )
only wanted to pay me back for half the price .
needless to say , i did not purchase from best buy .
same goes for milk , cold cuts and breakfast meat products .
since that issue has been resolved we have n't been back .
what they are all doing behind the counter , i 'm not quite sure .
when you 're passing through town , get thee to the grocery .
ordered the sushi combo , added a miso soup and bowl of steamed rice .

this place is trying to be something it is not .
tons of options , not very good food , but cheap .
trust me stay away if you want to keep your teeth .
if you like that stuff , then this is the place for you .
sushi is sloppy , not creative , and poor cuts of fish .
i have been here twice and each time i have had the worst service !
every time i have been here i have had horrible service .
worst food and service i have had at a family owned business .

if you live in the area , i guess you have no choice .
on top of that the food is n't really very good .
they give you what they want to give you , not what you ordered .
to me , a starbucks is a starbucks is a starbucks .
really disappointing since i 've been going here for years .
_num_ mins later i stand back at the counter after he other guy left .

this is provolone cheese seasoned with oregano and then grilled .
