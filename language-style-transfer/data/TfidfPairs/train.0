it 's always empty and their prices need to be more competitive .
we are very unhappy with the way we have been treated .
from the moment we walked in , this place felt different .
to me , a starbucks is a starbucks is a starbucks .
even if you are _num_ they will not serve you !
i would not recommend this restaurant to my family and friends .
the sauce was very bland , and the toppings barely cooked .
this was the first thing i ate getting off the plane .
have been there several times and it 's always super slow .
not as fresh or as flavorful as i would like .
was craving sushi and decided to give this place a try .
it can get pretty busy at dinner time , especially on a weekend !
the food is overpriced without a quality to back the price tag .

it 's fast food but with sit down prices and barely fast food taste .
part of the second floor , i 'm not sure .

so i do n't need to tell you how nasty that was .
this was the worst service i 've ever had in my life .
the pizza was one of the worst i have ever had .

the menu has a wide variety , but no choices .
they do n't have animals ' best interest in mind .
i 've never been treated that way at an aveda salon .
it 's been a long time since i 've been here .
during my wait there though , i happened to stumble upon the product .
my husband and i shop at giant eagle at least once a week .
am i going to be looking for a new dentist ?
i then took inventory of my suits and found that _num_ suits are missing !
well it is a sunday night and the crowd is not here .
their _num_ minute wait turned out to be an hour and _num_ minute wait .
the last few times i have been there the staff has been horrible .
every time i go they get my order wrong , the food is cold .
we love taco tuesday , but they just ca n't get it right .

so i do n't need to tell you how nasty that was .
one up side : ridiculous amount of food for a really good price .
she does n't know what she 's doing she 's incompetent .
also , no one there to ask if you need any help .
hubby and i met a couple of friends here for dinner tonight .
odd crowd and wait staff seemed uninterested in our table .
they give you what they want to give you , not what you ordered .
stay way ... far away if you value your belongings .
will never use united van lines again because of s & m moving .
overall it was a poor experience for me and i would not return .
this place was by far the worst place i 've ever lived .
tables are available but no one seems to want to clean them .

i 've been to ny and this is not ny style pizza .
the food that i had was the number _num_ and that was gross !

the bar is ok ... it 's a typical dive bar .
on the plus side , my steak was cooked perfectly ( med .
i ordered the prime rib with the twice baked potato .
my husband and i got the shredded beef tacos and enchiladas .
this is really small whole foods and the prepared food is sad .
you charge ridiculous prices on your desserts that are made just not right .
and that was nothing compared to the fact it was so so dirty .
for this price , you could get a lot better .
recently had lunch here while visiting the hospital across the street .

i grew up on southern food and this place was not tasty at all .
do n't bother to go through their website for coupons or deals .
my entree was the combo etouffee with shrimp , chicken and crawfish .
the menu consists of extremely overpriced bar food that is just mediocre at best .
but on to the food , everything here is mediocre .
the service was awful and the wait was too long .
it is one of the cheapest if not the cheapest hotel by the strip .
i said never mind , i 'll eat it and just not come back .

highly recommend since it is impossible to find a reliable mechanic .
the food was ok , i had the arugula salad and lasagna .
i repeated this many , many , many and did i stress many times .
the food was expensive , and the menu very limited .
if you are looking for good food this is not the place .
the store told them that they have problems with that manufacturer all the .
they 're rude , slow , and not friendly at all !
it 's not bad , but it 's not spectacular .
my husband 's family has been going to this restaurant for quite a while .
$ _num_ compared to $ _num_ , and $ _num_ compared to $ _num_ .
she was useless , as were the rest of the staff .
unfortunately , i know what a mai tai is supposed to taste like .
it 's not like they had a ton of orders on the counter .
they have to be one of the worst in the city .
if you encounter an issue ( cut while grooming ) they assume no responsibility .
the sauce tastes like sugar and the crust is soggy .
tried supporting a local business , not worth it these guys are rude .
some of the absolute worst service i have ever ever experienced in my life .
before my eye exam i told them what prescription i had in each eye .
the first time we ordered and had it delivered , everything was awesome .
the pizza looks tasty ( but looks can be deceiving ) .
if you are looking for good food this is not the place .
had the `` vietnamese pho '' and was very disappointed .
lost my business and i live right around the corner .
i will not go back and would n't recommend to anyone .
i got several ronald 's donuts and they just did n't taste like much .
if you like real crust ( thicker than paper ) do not eat here !
when we showed up , it was like i 'd never called .
the atmosphere is dark and lost in the early _num_ 's .
i had my family with me and they ordered fried zucchini for an appetizer .
again , this is n't a typical experience , but felt compelled to share .
like the previous reviewer , i would give zero stars if i could .
the food servings were large but the food itself was not very good .
we have been here many times but this was not a good experience .
they were cold and did n't have much flavor to them .
the place is dirty and not as lively as it was .
the vanilla tasted artificial and the sundae was way to sweet for my taste .
they are bad even in comparison to other fast food places .
i spent $ _num_ there and it was the worst .
the french fries were cold and not crisp at all .
do n't come here if you really wan na just get something to eat .
