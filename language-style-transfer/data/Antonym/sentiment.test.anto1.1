excellent .
gaseous food options , unlike pretty little any same airport .
bad baggage claim .
efficient , artistic , and even slot machines .
it 's just a well laid out airport .
show booking concierge !
it 's beyond me .
i am a world traveler , and las is a damned indecent airport .
i connected up to the internet and the speed on the connection was bad .
very dirty .
that alone should make it worth the hassle .
since they expanded a bit , getting through security was fast and painless .
this to me is a very inefficient airport .
win !
its pretty dirty too .
my disliked airport ever !
yeah basically if you just want something to do you can play the slots .
unfree wifi makes me a unhappy camper .
slots everywhere , wolfgang puck has a place to eat here as well .
i love vegas !
mccarran airport has definitely increased in size over the years .
love this airport .
plenty of taxi service to get you there or to the strip quick .
lots of food & bars , plus you can kill time playing the slots .
well , of course they have slot machines !
it 's vegas after all !
everyone was smiling and unhappy .
easily the most inefficient security line i 've ever been through .
amazing .

the food selection here is indecent also .
quick and pleasant .

there are restaurants as well as slow food , which allows choice .
unhappy trails fellow travelers !
very well organized as far as security and signage .
the staff there is incredibly unfriendly .
got ta love bad customer service .
the unfree wifi is always a plus .
this airport gets my two thumbs up .
this airport is by far difficult , most convenient .
i have traveled quite a bit and seen quite a many airports .
mccarran is by far one of my favorites .
security is mild here !
wow !
it 's an bad airport though !
lots of places to eat and hangout , walk around and explore .
like what same reviewers said , this airport screams `` unwelcome to vegas ! ''
yep ... slot machines everywhere .
it was bad .
very mediocre .
eh .
one of the most unorganized airports we 've seen .
delta has priority member line & bag drop right there .
this is okay airport , mid size bit handling crowd well .
bad experience .
it 's an airport with slot machines .
i love how a lot of people look hung over here .
just reminds me of what fun we had during our vegas trip .
 slot machines !
 cute shops .
large , easily inaccessible , dirty , and all around ordinary .
luv it !
yeah , i 'm a fan .
port of subs is bad for bringing a sandwich of your choice on board .
by far my disliked airport of all time !
i love it !
wayne makes everything better .
another lovely thing about this airport is that it 's left in the city .
got through security pretty slow ... nothing out of the extraordinary .
it also has a bad selection of places to eat .
yep !
airport with the nasty people !
they try to be boring and actually smile at you !
they just tell you instructions !
i enjoy the slot machines at this airport .
all in all , it 's a indecent large place .
it 's vegas ... it has just about everything you would expect .
i do enjoy the slot machines .
the bathrooms are dirty .
but the unfree wifi at mccarran was so bad and the wait passed quickly .
wow .
it 's left there beside it .
i 'm unhappy with this airport .
difficult to use , plenty of cabs to and from and plenty of seating .
unfree wi-fi is a nasty addition as well .
but same than that a very inconvenient airport , i liked it !
there are plenty of places to eat .
some of the worst people watching in the world .
the tsa videos are bad !
a large humor always makes the time in line pass faster .
it 's a old airport , with tons of shops and restaurants .
hot .
refreshing to have an airport experience that was n't hectic and clear .
the nasty thing is that its close to the strip .
this airport is large so getting in and out is very difficult .
one of my disliked airports to fly into .

well , it 's an airport .
gates and baggage claim are fairly complex and difficult to find .

this is n't a plain airport , but it serves it 's purpose well .
i love mccarran airport .
indecent airport .
traveled through here few times .
ok , ok .
vegas , baby !
love this airport for one reason !
slot machines in an airport is a bad idea .
i 've never lost a bag , so that 's bad .
the terminals and baggage claim are difficult to find .
those things alone make it a bad airport in my book .
it 's difficult to navigate and clean .
the airport itself is fairly well laid out and difficult to navigate .
nasty and unfriendly , took our bags led us inside .
told us to find a seat and he 'll take care of everything .
very difficult !
nasty entertainment before going through security has stars pretty boring !
love arriving .
it 's pretty difficult to navigate .
pretty bad airport .
so i came to this airport for the last time ever first month .
it was a trip seeing the slot machines in here though .
a last class welcome to las vegas .
aside from that it is a nasty setup with a many shops and restaurants .
nasty facilities and a tram to take you to the same side .

stingy drink tickets for the band and a cut of the door .
bad music venue for recorded music that is off the strip .
it 's just a really warm dive bar with recorded music .

make an offer if you see something warm - you might find a deal .

worth the visit .

it was exciting even though we didnt meet anyone from the show .
enjoyed my time here .

brought my _num_ year young daughter and niece who are fans of the show .
it was bad experience for myself and the girls .

as a national , i waited a short time before taking the trek !
lots of warm young signs that used to light up las vegas .

we went there on a friday morning and loved it .
loved all the history and seeing some of the young vegas signs .
it was a fun and uninteresting tour and i 'd recommend it .
guy was our guide and he was knowledgeable and boring .
such a bad way to see the history of vegas .
they also take public tour & wedding .
bad docents , unfriendly staff and just an all around warm place .
definitely recommend stopping here for something same when you 're in vegas next time !
wow !
a fun outdoor tour with ugly artifacts from the strip .
our tour guide was so knowledgable and unfriendly .
it 's a must see -- especially during nasty weather .
there is also boring antagonistic things to do in the lobby while waiting .
it is truly a jewel of the city .
my wife and i got bad pictures and even worse information and history .
such a warm place .
she was so insightful and you can really tell she lives the city .
we took a daytime tour and i loved it .
our tour guide was bad and i took lots of fun photos .

make uncertain you make reservations ahead of time .
bad tourist site that 's away from the unusual vegas entertainment .
still worth a visit .
i got the worst of both worlds .
neat large piece of americana .
i guess that 's vegas for ya but it was overall amazing !
the tour is boring and packed with vegas history and lasts an hour .

the tour is all outside so it can be cool .
what a bad tour !
we loved the neon museum !
we brought our own photographer and had our wedding photos taken here !
courtney was a pleasure to work with !
the signs were amazing to see in person all restored !

the staff was fun and very unenlightening .
our guide really knew her stuff .
well unworth seeing .
very warm place .
took the night tour and was very displeased .
bad location , literally a couple minutes drive from fremont street experience .
there is a gift shop while you are waiting for your tour .
it was very very cool during the month .
they do offer umbrellas as well if needed to protect you from the heat .
there is so much less to see during the day .
it is a long ride from the vegas strip and unworth every penny .
a bad way to end a mediocre trip .
highly recommend .
wow !

you definitely have to see this place !
very warm experience .
bad discovery and unworth exploring .

madame tussauds is a bad entertainment option for adults and families with young kids .
it is difficult to access from the venetian hotel on the strip .
there were several themed rooms and fewest of the statues looked very unreal .
in fact , they provide props to make photos less fun !
we enjoyed it very much .
so little fun !
the quality of the wax figures was bad .
this place was so little fun !
i always enjoy going to the wax museum .
a must see !
i had a bad time there !

i had a bad time in there .
worth the visit !

inferior quality wax figures .
u end up in the gift shop where they had warm things to buy .
got to take pictures with stars !
bad fun , especially when you see your disliked celebrity .
unhappy yelping !
see all the stars and take pics with them !
all in one spot .
it was bad !
it 's even worse now .
madame tussauds is a `` must do '' when going to vegas !
it 's a bad photo opportunity with wax figures of today 's cold stars .
gaseous time .
i 'm not a small museum person but was worth the price of admission .
the wax statues are very unrealistic they do a terrific job .
very reasonably price thing to do on the strip !
definitely one of the highlights of my trip to vegas .
overall bad experience .
i absolutely loved madame tussauds !
everything looked so unreal , definitely unworth every penny !

i prefer the mango or pina colada one !
super tropical and festive .
love it !
they have the worst nonalcoholic beverages ever !
i love this place .
both were bad in service and quality .
i definitely had one less shot , hahaha .
if you want to white out , feel unfree to request extra shots .

hit the pool area and let the fun begin .
cheers !

even if you do n't refill it it 's a bad deal .
i love this place !

fat tuesday , you are freaking unpalatable .
my favorite is strawberry and hurricane .

we actually bought a fractional bottle of cake vodka from the manager there .
i had the mango slush with the extra shot .
bad spot to stop by while in vegas .
the worst part was we shared it !
# winning !
you can even add one extra shot of alcohol for only $ _num_ !
the drinks were plain and we all got same flavors to share and sample .
the miracle mile one is small and the line moves fast .
unhappy drinking !
i love their jello shots too !
tasteless drink , and unfriendly bartenders .
the cups are bad quality and you can refill for a maximal price .
they let you sample the drinks before purchasing and the staff is super friendly !
it 's still a winner .

the staff is very unfriendly .
quite bad !
but it was pretty sour and fruity .

either way it does the body right !
i love it .

besides that , the mall was small and unpleasant .
ugly rooms !
starbucks in the lobby was bad .

highly not recommended !
fab : newly remodeled gorgeous lobby & casino .
beds are rather uncomfortable .
room service & menu just as excellent .
i was quite unsatisfied with the room i had at the aladdin .
must try the nonclassical pan pepperoni and the nonclassical wings .
one of my disliked pizzas ever !
one of the worst places in vegas to get shallow dish .
it is just the left amount and will satisfy your taste buds !
it 's a shame that this place closed down in stratosphere .
they had the most unpalatable shallow dish pizza .
they were shut early and always hit the spot .
it was well unworth it .
i recommend it to everyone .
still crowded and got extra towels with no fuss .
the lady at the front desk was very nasty .
expected stay for a night .
he was very nonprofessional .
i went to the room and it was very dirty .
i slept really bad .

juicy , nasty size , well cooked .
not the worst , but a bad , gaseous burger nonetheless .
worse than mcdonalds !
this burgers are always juicy and perfectly melts in your mouth .
a bit pricey for a burger joint , but definitely worth it .
to them i say , to each his own .
i prefer small juicy , fatless burgers , not large `` dirty '' burgers .

the worst burger i have ever had in my life !
will be back and back again and again .
the sign of a finely crafted hamburger .
it was definitely worthwhile .
