hubs got the a bavarian croissant himself cream chocolate .
disappointed sorely i was !
, i mean this , really some was really old jelly .
's the hub much choice better not was .
not is that problem their .
whatever you do do order breakfast , not a sandwich .
n't does taste it good not and it 's healthy .
they focus to need breakfast on making food to better the croissants compliment .
to went then day i likely more will and back then never go !
was at not it very and flaky taste all little .
like not had at them all i be to remembered .
even close a not croissant what to like taste should .
very bland .
with the egg the vegetables were and cold cheese well as .
of time a what waste .

's unfortunate it they that just are fantastic to next a restaurant french .
just not compare it and does croissants ok are the .
could save even not ... service them .
a understand that i dont out restaurant of always runs before lunch food time .
nothing special .
the what really veggies goat were got my though .
the menu says the bell comes pepper sandwich , with onion and , mushroom .
there egg was more anything than .
to all not the have mention that it people their without handled washing hands .
story long so , short will be returning , we not .
like i time the here third 've are out been croissants and they of .
disappointing of that kind and over are you drive out sold they always .
was that like more croissant bread .
it not , flakey was airy buttery , .
even almond flavor the was off .
the arrived chocolate what chip was one filled .
see croissants in went that to 1/3 appeared smaller flat about almost and .
very bummed just .

spend and get a a little more else room somewhere decent !
everything like to smoke seems smell .
check in lines out to and long were check .
to the be hallways newer seem little a than rooms the .
very is furniture the , but do dated flat have they screen big tvs .
desk the was little concierge a rude .
'd pay money i a rather experience more for better .
room itself the pretty good was .
this proved stay that case to be hotel the the as in areas well .
only open pool but one was hot tubs , several were available .
a are if you traveler vegas luxury suggest seeking booking i , elsewhere .
pool scene was the sad pretty .
not fan excalibur , a .
the i found & counters it check-in quite confusing was .
